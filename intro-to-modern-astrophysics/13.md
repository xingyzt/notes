## 13. Main Sequence and Post-Main-Sequence Stellar Evolution

* Generally dominated by nuclear reaction timescale
* Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale relevant when transitioning between nuclear sources

### Main sequence (MS)

* Stars $0.3\sim1.2 M_\odot$:
  * Initially, core burns H, predominantly via PP chain
    * Radiative due to low temperature dependence
    * Core burning radius, density, and temperature rise due to fusion’s increase of
      mean molecular weight causing contraction and release of gravitational energy
    * Surface luminosity, radius, and effective temperature consequently rise over lifetime
  * Temperature high enough to burn thick H shell around core immediately after core H depletion
    * Core now isothermal and predominantly He, growing as He ash rains down from shell
    * Shell H burning generates more power than core H burning, but some of it is
      converted into gravitational potential through slow expansion of envelope
    * Effective temperature decreases slightly
  * **Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit**, max mass fraction of an isothermal core
    in hydrostatic equilibrium supported by ideal gas pressure:
    ${M' \over M} \lesssim 0.37 \left(\mu\over\mu'\right)^2$
    * Where M′ and \mu′ are mass and mean molecular weights of the core
    * Derived from hydrostatic pressure: ${dP \over dM} = –{Gm \over 4\pi r^4}$
  * After reaching SC limit, core contracts on Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale
    unless mass is low enough to be supported by temperature-independent
    electron degeneracy pressure: $P \propto \rho^{5\over3}$
* Stars $\gtrsim 1.2 M_\odot$:
  * Initially, core nearly homogeneous due to convective mixing
  * Convection zone decreases in mass during H burning
    * Shrinks faster for more massive stars,
      disappearing entirely before H exhaustion for stars \gtrsim 10 M_\odot
    * Leaves slight composition gradient
  * After near-exhaustion of core H ($X \approx 0.05$ for $M \approx 5 M_\odot$), entire star contracts
    on Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale while increasing luminosity and effective temperature

### Subgiant branch (SGB)

* Low-mass stars:
  * Rapid core contraction releases gravitational energy,
    expanding envelope and decreasing effective temperature
  * Raised H shell temperature and density rapidly increases power generation,
    again expanding envelope
* Massive stars:
  * Rising temperatures eventually trigger rapid ignition of thick H shell around core,
    forcing slight expansion of star envelope,
    momentarily decreasing luminosity and temperature

### Red giant branch (RGB)

* Low- and intermediate-mass stars:
  * Near-surface convection zone created for
    due to $\text{H}^-$ ions increasing photospheric opacity
* All stars:
  * Star rises along Hayashi track as convection zone dominates star interior
  * First dredge-up: convection sinks elements from surface ($\text{Li}$, $^{12}_6\text{C}$, etc)
    and surfaces products of nuclear processes ($^3_2\text{He}$, $^{14}_7\text{N}$, etc)

### Red giant tip / start of helium fusion

* Stars $\lesssim 1.8 M_\odot$:
  * He core becomes strongly electron-degenerate
  * Significant neutrino losses create negative temperature gradient near center
  * Helium core flash: explosive initiation of triple-alpha process in He core in seconds
    * Core is rapidly lifted out of degeneracy outside-in, with
      strong temperature dependence of triple-alpha driving extreme thermal runaway
    * Briefly generates $\approx 10^{11} L_\odot$ of power, but most is absorbed in thermalizing core
* All stars;
  * Core expands from He burning, pushing H-burning shell outward
  * Luminosity abruptly decreases due to cooling of H-burning shell
  * Effective temperature begins to increase due to envelope contraction

### Horizontal branch (HB) / blue loop

* Stars $\lesssim 15 M_\odot$:
  * Envelope contraction raises effective temperature
    and compresses H-burning shell, increasing power generation
  * Deep convection zone rises towards surface while triple-\alpha makes core convective as well
  * Many develop instabilities in outer envelope, leading to periodic pulsations
  * Increase in mean molecular mass eventually causes core contraction,
    expanding envelope and lowering effective temperature
  * Depletion of core He rapidly accelerates core contraction
    * Core now mostly C and O, becoming very degenerate and
      cooling through significant neutrino production
  * Contraction and heating of surrounding He shell initiates He shell burning,
    in turn forcing expansion and cooling of surrounding H shell,
    temporarily halting H shell burning
* Stars $\gtrsim 15 M_\odot$ do not experience the blue loop

### Early asymptotic giant branch (E-AGB)

* All stars:
  * He-burning shell generates most power while H-burning shell is nearly inactive
  * Convective envelope absorbs energy and expands, lowering effective temperature
  * **Second dredge-up**: convection deepens again,
    bringing He and N from interior onto H-rich envelope
  * Star back on Hayashi track, approaching previous RGB path asymptotically from the left
  * Rapid mass loss due to low surface gravity

### Thermally-pulsating AGB (TP-AGB)

* All stars:
  * As He-burning shell nears exhaustion, H shell reignites
  * He ash from H-burning shell builds up and makes base of He shell slightly degenerate,
    eventually triggering helium shell flash
  * Convection zone established between He- and H-burning shells
  * He-burning expands and cools H-burning shell, gradually turning it off
  * Process repeats with growing amplitude after every pulse
  * Cycle evident from abrupt changes in surface luminosity
  * Period ranges from $\sim10^3 \text{ years}$ for stars $\sim5 M_\odot$ to $10^5 \text{ years}$ for stars $\sim0.6 M_\odot$
    * Long-Period Variables (LPVs) such as Mira have 100-700-day periods
* Stars $\gtrsim 2 M_\odot$
  * **Third dredge-up**: convection envelope merges with inter-shell convection zone
    and surfaces material from C-synthesizing region
  * Inverting number ratio of O and C in stellar atmosphere creates carbon stars,
    with spectral type C overlapping the traditional K and M
    * Spectral type S inbetween M and C has approximately equal O and C abundances
  * Mass loss in cool temperatures (~3000 K) expels into ISM
    silicate grains from O-rich atmospheres and graphite grains from C-rich atmospheres
  * **S-process nucleosynthesis**:
    nuclei in deep interior capture neutrons produced by nuclear burning,
    at a slow enough rate to radioactively decay before their next capture
  * S and C-type stars dredge up elements with no stable isotopes (e.g. Tc) into atmosphere,
    indicating active s-process

### Late and post-AGB

* Stars $\lesssim 8 M_\odot$:
  * He-burning increases mass of CO core, causing contraction until
    electron degeneracy pressure dominates
  * Mass loss accelerates with decreasing mass and increasing radius,
    developing $\sim10^{-4} M_\odot/\text{year}$ superwind
    * Precise mechanism unknown
    * Energizes shroud of optically thick dust clouds into OH\overIR sources:
      the $\text{OH}$ molecules emit IR as masers
  * Mass loss prevents catastrophic core collapse from Chandrasekhar limit,
    allowing stars between $4\sim8 M_\odot$ to additionally synthesize $\text{Ne}$ and $\text{Mg}$ in cores
  * Surrounding dust cloud eventually becomes optically thin from expansion,
    revealing an F or G supergiant
  * AGB phase ends as envelope is expelled, moving star nearly horizontally blueward
  * Luminosity drops rapidly as H and He-burning shells lose pressure and extinguish,
    revealing hot, degenerate C–O or ONeMg core: a white dwarf
  * Planetary nebula: expanding shell of gas around white dwarf
    * Emitting visible spectrum due to UV from central star remnant
    * Complex morphologies due to preferentially equatorial ejection
    * Receding at 10~30 km/s, with character length scales of ~0.3 pc
* Stars $\gtrsim 8 M_\odot$: see Ch. 15

### Stellar populations

* Stars give ISM back material enriched with more heavy elements than given
* **Population III**: stars formed soon after the Big Bang with virtually no metals ($Z = 0$)
  * Found in extreme deep field observations to primordial galaxies
* **Population II**: succeeding generations of metal-poor stars ($Z \gtrsim 0$)
  * Found outside galactic disk and in globular clusters
* **Population I**: current generations of metal-rich stars ($Z \approx 0.03$)
  * Found inside galactic disk and in open clusters

### Stellar clusters

* Stars formed from the same cloud, with similar compositions and birth times
  * Globular clusters: Population II, larger and older
  * Galactic \over open clusters: Population I, smaller and younger
* Graphed onto color-magnitude diagrams:
  H–R diagrams with B–V indices rather than effective temperatures,
  and apparent instead of absolute magnitudes if distance is not known
* Distance generally calculated with spectroscopic parallax
* Isochrone: curve fitting all stars of a cluster at a certain age
* Main-sequence turn-off point:
  color and magnitude where stars are currently leaving main sequence
  * Reflects age of cluster as point becomes redder and less luminous over time,
* Hertzsprung gap: absence of stars between late main sequence and red giant regions
  due to rapid Kelvin–Helmholtz-timescale intermediate evolution
* Blue stragglers: group of stars found above turn-off point, possibly
  due to mass exchange with binary companion or collision between stars
