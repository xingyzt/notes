## 14. Stellar Pulsation

### Observations

* Pulsating stars dim and brighten as radius and temperature change
* **Long-Period Variables** (LPVs; prototype: $\omicron$ Ceti / Mira):
  thermally-pulsating asymptotic giants with $100\sim700$-day periods and somewhat irregular light curves
  * May pulsate in either fundamental or first overtone mode
* **Classical Cepheids** (prototype: $\delta$ Cephei):
  supergiant Ib stars with 1–50-day periods proportional to their average luminosities
  * **Period–luminosity relation** (Leavitt’s law):
    $V = –2.81 \log_{10} P – 1.43$,
    $H = –3.234 \log_{10} P + 16.079$
    * Where $P$ is period in days
    * Measuring magnitude in the IR H-band mitigates some interstellar extinction
  * **Period–luminosity–color relation**:
    $H = –3.428 \log_{10} P + 1.54(J – K_s) + 15.637$
    * Where J–K_s is an IR color index
    * Adding color term improves data fit
  * Used as “**standard candles**” for measuring intergalactic distances
  * Luminosity variation primarily due to $\sim1000$ K variation in temperature,
    with a phase lag of maximum luminosity occuring behind minimum radius
  * Vast majority pulsate in fundamental mode
* **W Virginis stars**:
  Population II Cepheids, around $4 \times$ less luminous than classical Cepheids of the same period
  * Vast majority pulsate in fundamental mode
* **RR Lyrae stars**:
  horizontal-branch Population II stars with 1.5–24-hour periods,
  all having nearly the same luminosity
  * May pulsate in either fundamental or first overtone mode
* **$\delta$ Scuti variables**:
  evolved F stars near the main sequence, with both radial and nonradial oscillations
  on 1–3-hour periods
* **ZZ Ceti stars**: pulsating white dwarfs with 100–1000-second periods
* **Instability strip**: narrow, nearly vertical region on H–R diagram,
  right of the main sequence, where most pulsating stars are found,
  including the above types
* **$\beta$ Cephei stars**: luminous (class III–V) blue variables with 3–7-hour periods;
  found in H–R’s upper left, outside the instability strip

### Radial pulsation mechanisms

* Oscillations result from standing sound waves in interior
  * Sound waves in medium with adiabatic index $\gamma$ travel at $v = \sqrt{\gamma P\over\rho}$
  * No displacement at nodes; maximum displacement at antinodes
* **Period–mean density relation**: $\Pi \approx \sqrt{3\pi\over2\gamma G\rho}$
  * Denser stars (e.g. white dwarfs) pulsate faster (than e.g. supergiants)
* Modes given by conical harmonics
  * Fundamental mode: node at star center, antinode at surface
  * Each overtone adds a node between center and surface
* Surface amplitudes decreases with overtone:
   ${\delta r\over R} \approx 0.07$ for fundamental, $\lesssim 0.01$ for first, $\approx 0$ for second
* Eddington modeled stars as heat engines:
  layers doing positive net work on surroundings drive oscillations;
  those doing negative net work dampen them
  * Positive work done if layer absorbs heat around max compression;
    releases heat and reaches max pressure during expansion
* **Nuclear $\epsilon$-mechanism**:
  compressing center raises temperature and density, increasing power generation
  * Amplitude usually too small to drive pulsation
  * May contribute to preventing formation of $\gtrsim 90 M_\odot$ stars
* Opacity $\kappa$ and $\gamma$ mechanisms:
  compressing layer increases opacity and traps heat, driving expansion
  * For most layers, opacity decreases with increased temperature from compression
  * **$\kappa$-mechanism**: in partial ionization zones however,
    some compression energy goes into further ionization instead of direct heating,
    letting opacity increase with the higher density
  * **$\gamma$-mechanism**: heat prefers to flow into partial ionization zone in compression
    due to its lower relative temperature, reinforcing the $\kappa$-mechanism
* Most stars have two main ionization zones
  * **Hydrogen partial ionization zone**: broader and closer to surface;
    ionizes $\text{H I} \to \text{H II}$ and $\text{He I} \to \text{He II}$ at characteristic temperature of $1–1.5 \times 10^4 \text{ K}$;
    changing depths during pulsation accounts for phase lag in classical Cepheids and RR Lyrae
  * **He II partial ionization zone**: narrower and deeper;
    ionizes $\text{He II} \to \text{He III}$ at characterstic temperature of $4 \times 10^4 \text{ K}$;
    primarily responsible for driving oscillations within instability strip
* Temperature-dependent depths of ionization zones determine pulsation properties:
  * Blue edge of instability strip (~7500 K):
    high temperatures puts ionization zone too close to low-density surface,
    where there is insufficient mass to effectively drive oscillations
  * First overtone may be excited ~6500 K
  * Fundamental mode takes hold ~5500 K
  * Red edge of instability strip (~5000 K):
    heat transfer by convection bypasses high-opacity ionization zones
    and quenches pulsation
* $\beta$ Cephei stars pulsate due to iron ionization zone
  * Effective temperature (20,000~30,000 K) too high for H and He ionization zones
  * $\kappa$ and $\gamma$ mechanisms rely on $\text{Fe}$ opacity bump near $10^5 \text{ K}$

### Pulsation model

* Newton’s second law must be used instead of hydrostatic equilibrium model
  to account for oscillation of mass shells:
  $\rho {d^2r \over dt^2} = - {GM\rho \over r^2} - {dP \over dr}$
* Nonlinear evaluation can model complex, nonsinusoidal behavior of large-amplitude pulsations,
  but is very computationally expensive
* Linearizable by approximating with small amplitudes,
  but results in sinusoidal oscillations with no amplitude information
* Adiabatic approximation also used to minimize complexity,
  but nonlinear, nonadiabatic models are necessary for some variable stars
* One-zone linear, adiabatic model: $\Pi = {2\pi \over \sqrt{{4\pi \over 3} G\rho(3\gamma–4) }}$
* **Dynamic stability**: star collapses if $\gamma < {4\over3}$

### Nonradial pulsation mechanisms

* Some regions of surface expand while others contract
* Oscillations result from standing sound waves with latitudinal nodal circles
  and traveling sound waves with longitudinal nodal circles
  * No displacement at nodal circles
* **Angular modes** given by real parts of spherical harmonic functions: $Y^m_l(\theta, \phi)$
  * There are $l$ nodal circles: $\lvert m\rvert$ longitudes and $l - \lvert m \rvert$ latitudes
  * Where $l \in Z^+$ and $m \in [-l, l]$
  * Traveling waves take $\vert m\rvert\cdot\Pi$ long to travel around star,
    with direction dependent on sign of $m$
* Pressure waves: **p-modes**
  * Confined to low depths, revealing conditions in stellar surface layers
  * Both radial and angular nodes
  * Acoustic frequency $S = \sqrt{\gamma P \over \rho} {\sqrt{l(l+1)} \over r}$
  * Frequencies split by prograde and retrograde wave motion
    proportional to star rotation rate: $\Delta S \propto m\Omega$
* Internal gravity waves: **g-modes**
  * Reveals movement of stellar material in deep interior
  * Only have angular nodes
  * **Brunt–Väisälä bouyancy frequency**: $N = \sqrt{–Ag}$
  * Confined to radiative zones, where $A < 0$: $A \equiv {1\over\gamma P} {dP \over dr} – {1\over\rho} {d\rho \over dr}$
* Surface gravity waves: **f-modes**
  * Frequency inbetween p- and g-modes

### Helioseismology and asteroseismology

* All observed solar oscillations are in the p-mode, with 3–8-minute periods and
  very short (high $l$) horizontal wavelengths
* Likely driven by turbulent energy of convection zone
* Latitide-dependent rotation rate revealed by m-dependent frequency splitting
* Depth-dependent rotation rate revealed by $l$-dependent attenuation below convection zone
* Thick convection zone prevents surface observation of of g-modes
* $\delta$ Scuti stars tend to pulsate in low-overtone radial modes, low-order p-modes,
  and possibly g-modes
* **Rapidly oscillating peculiar A stars** (roAp) primarily pulsate in higher-order
  p-modes, with the pulsation axis aligned with their strong magnetic fields
  instead of the rotation axis
