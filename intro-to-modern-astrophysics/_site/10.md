## 10. The Interiors of Stars

* Direct observation only possible with neutrinos and the occasional supernovae
* Study requires physically accurate computer models that match observable surface features

### Hydrostatic equilibrium

* Equilibrium condition requires pressure gradient to counteract gravity: ${dP \over dr} = −\rho g$
  * **Local gravity** $g \equiv {G M_r \rho \over r^2}$, where $M_r$ is mass enclosed within $r$
* Mass conservation ${dM_r \over dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho$
* Total pressure $P = {\rho kT \over \mu} + {aT^4\over3}$
  * Where first term is ideal gas law and second term is radiation pressure
  * With as mean molecular weight

### Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism

* Contraction releases gravitational energy $\Delta E \approx {3\over10} {GM^2 \over R}$
* Gravitational energy contribution $\epsilon = −{dQ \over dt} = −T {dS \over dt}$
  * Where specific entropy: $dS \equiv {dQ \over T}$
  * Contraction produces heat and decreases entropy;
    vise versa for expansion
* **Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale** of star $t = {\Delta E\over L}$, $t_\odot \approx 10^7 \text{ years}$

### Nuclear fusion

* Releases difference in strong nuclear force binding energy:
  * $E = \Delta m_0c^2 = ( Z m_\text{p} + (A−Z) m_\text{n} − m_\text{nucleus} ) c^2$
* Timescale $t_\odot \approx 10^{10}$
* Must overcome Coulombic repulsion between positive nucleons: $\sim10^6$ eV at $r \approx 10^{-15}$ m
* Thermal energy of gas: $E = {\mu v^2 \over 2} = {p^2 \over 2\mu}$
  * Where $\mu$ is reduced mass and $v$ is average relative velocity
* Requires impossibly high temperatures in classical physics:
  $E = {3\over2} kT = {q_1q_2 \over 4\pi r \epsilon_0} \to T \approx 10^{10} \text{ K}$ for H–H fusion
* With quantum tunneling (de Broglie $\lambda = {h \over p} \approx r$):
  $E = {(h/\lambda)^2\over2\mu} = {q_1q_2 \over 4\pi\lambda\epsilon_0} \to T \approx 10^7 \text{ K}$, consistent with solar core temperature estimates
* Reaction rate depends on velocity (wavelength) distribution, densities, and
  cross-sectional area of particles 1 and 2: $r = \int n_1 \; n_2 \; \sigma(E) \; v(E) \; { n(E)\over n} \; dE$
  * Power-law approximation: $r = r_0 \; X_1 \; X_2 \; \rho^{\alpha'} \; T^\beta$,
    * Where $X$ are mass fractions, $\alpha' \approx 2$, and $\beta$ ranging from ~1 to ≥40
* Velocity distribution follows Maxwell–Boltzmann
* Cross section $\sigma(E) = {S \over E} e^{−b/\sqrt E}$
  * Where de Broglie area is $\pi\lambda^2 \propto {1\over p^2} \propto {1\over E}$,
    and tunneling across barrier of energy $U$ is $e^{‐2\pi^2 U/E} \propto e^{−b/\sqrt E}$,
    with $b \propto q_1q_2\sqrt\mu$
  * $S$ may be slow-varying function of $E$, or may have sharp peaks from resonance of
    specific energy levels within the nucleus
* **Electron screening** from sea of free e$^-$ partially hides nuclei,
  reducing effective charge and Coulomb barrier,
  sometimes enhancing He production by 10–50%
* Likelihood of nuclear reaction: $e^{−b/\sqrt E} e^{−E/kT}$
  * Product of velocity distribution’s high-energy tail and the quantum tunneling terms
  * Most likely energy ("**Gamow peak**") $E_0 = \left(bkT\over2\right)^{2\over3}$
* **Luminosity gradient** ${dL_r \over dr} = 4\pi r^2\rho$,
  * Where $L_r$ is luminosity enclosed in $r$,
    and $\epsilon$ is specific power (power released per mass)

### Nucleosynthesis

* *Notation: $^A_Z\text{He}$, where $A$ is atomic mass number and $Z$ is proton number*
* Simultaneous 4-body collision $4 {\;}^1_1\text{H} + ? \to {\;}^4_2\text{He} + ?$ extremely unlikely
* Reaction chain of 2-body interactions more probable
* Interactions must obey conservation laws:
  electric charge, nucleon number, and lepton number
* **Proton–proton chain** (H burning): $4 {\;}^1_1\text{H} \to {\;}^4_2\text{He} + 2\text{e}^+ + 2\nu + 2\gamma$
  * Three branches (see Fig. 10.8)
  * In Sun, 69% PP I, 31% PP II, 0.3% PP III
  * Near $T = 1.5 \times 10^7 \text{ K}$, $\epsilon \approx \epsilon_0 \rho X_\text{H}^2 \left(T \over 10^6 \text{ K}\right)^4$
    * Where $\epsilon_0 = 1.08 \times 10^{-12} \text{ W}\;\text{m}^3\;\text{kg}^{-2}$
* **CNO cycle** (H burning): $\text{C}$, $\text{N}$, and $\text{O}$ are catalysts
  * Two main branches, with the second only occuring ~0.04% of the time
  * Near $T = 1.5 \times 10^7 \text{ K}$, $\epsilon \approx \epsilon_0 \rho X_\text{H} X_\text{CNO} \left(T \over 10^6 \text{ K}\right)^{20}$
    * Where $\epsilon_0 = 8.24 \times 10^{-31} \text{ W}\;\text{m}^3\;\text{kg}^{-2}$
    * Much more temperature-dependent, only dominating in more massive stars
* **Triple-alpha process** (He burning): $2 {\;}^4_2\text{H} \leftrightarrow {\;}^8_4\text{Be}$, ${\;}^8_4\text{Be} + {\;}^4_2\text{He} \to {\;}^{12}_6\text{C} + \gamma$
  * First step produces an extremely unstable $^8_4\text{Be}$,
    thus combined is essentially a 3-body interaction: $r \propto (\rho Y)^3$
  * $\epsilon \approx \epsilon_0 \rho^2 Y^3 \left(T \over 10^8 \text{ K}\right)^{41}$
    * Incredibly strong temperature dependence
* **Alpha process** (C & O burning): $^{12}\_6\text{C} + {\;}^4_2\text{He} → {\;}^{16}\_8\text{O} + \gamma$, $^{16}\_8\text{O} + {\;}^4_2\text{He} \to {\;}^{20}\_{10}\text{Ne} + \gamma$
  * Alpha capture becomes prohibitive at higher $Z$ due to higher Coulomb barrier
  * C–C burning near $6 \times 10^8$ K and O–O burning near $10^9$ K can produce Na, Mg, Si, P, and S;
    some are endothermic but are normally less likely
* Binding energy per nucleon ${E\over A}$
  * Relative to atomic number $A$, local maxima are very stable
  * Magic nuclei: some elements ($^4_2$He, $^{16}_8$O) have unusually high ${E\over A}$
  * Broad peak around $^{56}_{26}$Fe, the most stable nuclei

### Energy transport and thermodynamics

* Three mechanisms: radiation of photons (affected by opacity),
  convection, and conduction (generally insignificant)
* **Radiative temperature gradient** ${dT \over dr} = −{3\over4ac} {\kappa\rho \over T^3} {L\over4\pi r^2}$
* If temperature gradient becomes too steep, convection takes hold
* Convection is much more complicated than radiation
  * Strongly coupled to the star’s dynamic behavior
  * 3D Navier–Stokes with turbulence is hard compute
  * **Pressure scale height**, convection’s characteristic length scale,
    is big: $H \equiv −P {dr \over dP} \approx {P\over\rho g} \approx {R_*\over 10}$
* **First law of thermodynamics**: $dU = dQ − dW = dQ − P \;dV$
  * $U$ is a state function; $Q$ and $W$ are not — $dQ$ and $dW$ are inexact differentials
* **Specific heat capacity** $C \equiv {\partial Q \over \partial T}$, $C_P = C_V + nR$
  * $C_P$ is at constant pressure; $C_V$ is at constant volume
  * Heat capacity ratio / **adiabatic index** $\gamma \equiv {C_P \over C_V}$
  * $\gamma = {5\over3}$ for a monoatomic gas;
    approaches 1 in a partial ionization zone as both specific heats increase
* Isochoric process ($dV = 0$): $dU = dQ = C_V \;dT$
* Adiabatic process ($dQ = 0$): $dU = −P \;dV$
  * Gas law: $P \propto {1 \over V^\gamma} \propto \rho^\gamma \propto T^{\gamma/(\gamma−1)}$
  * **Speed of sound** $v = \sqrt{B\over\rho} = \sqrt{\gamma P \over \rho}$
    * Where bulk modulus $B \equiv −V {\partial P \over \partial V} \;\{dQ = 0\} $
* **Adiabatic temperature gradient** ${dT \over dr} = −\left(1 − {1\over\gamma}\right) {\mu \over k} {GM \over r^2} = −{g \over C_P}$
* If the surrounding temperature gradient is steeper than the bubble’s,
  even just slightly, the condition becomes **superadiabatic**,
  and nearly all luminosity is transferred outwards adiabatically,
  via convection instead of radiation
  * Equivalent criterion: ${d(\ln P) \over d(\ln T)} < {\gamma \over \gamma − 1}$, = 2.5 for ideal monoatomic gas
* In general, convection occurs if a region
  1. has high opacity (surrounding ${dT \over dr} \propto \kappa$),
  2. is ionizing and raising the specific heat capacity (bubble ${dT \over dr} \propto {1 \over C_P}$), or
  3. has a highly temperature-dependent fusion process
* First two conditions can occur simultaneously;
  third only occurs deep in the interior with the CNO or triple-alpha processes
* Convective flux under mixing-length theory:
  $F = \rho C_P {k\over\mu} \left({T \over g} \delta\left(dT \over dr\right)\right)^{3/2} \alpha^2 \sqrt\beta$
  * Where $0.5 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim 3$ and $0 \lesssim \beta \lesssim 1$ are free parameters
    * $\alpha \equiv {l\over H}$, the ratio of the mixing length
      (distance traveled by bubble before thermaliing with surrounding)
      and the pressure scale height
    * $\beta : \beta v^2$ is the average kinetic energy of the bubble as it travels over $l$

### Stellar model building

* Basic stellar models need constructive relations for $P$, $\bar\kappa$, and $\epsilon$:
  expressing them in terms of density, temperature, and composition
  * $P$ (pressure) generally modelable with ideal gas law and radiation pressure,
    but is more complex in certain stars’ deep interiors
  * $\bar\kappa$ (mean opacity) calculated explicitly from tabular data or fitting functions
  * $\epsilon$ (specific power) calculated analytically from reaction networks
* Boundary conditions:
  * As $r \to 0$, $\{M_r, L_r\} \to 0$
  * And ignoring extended atmospheres and mass loss:
    as $r \to R_*$, $\{T, P, \rho\} \to 0$
* **Vogt–Russell theorem**:
  due to a star’s dependence on nuclear burning,
  its mass and internal composition uniquely determine
  its radius, luminosity, internal structure, and subsequent evolution
  * Ignores smaller influences such as magnetic fields and rotation
* General modeling numeric integrates shell-by-shell
  with the system of differential equations,
  often from from a transition point towards both the surface and the center
* **Polytropes**: simplified stellar models in which $P(\rho) \propto \rho^\gamma$
* **Lane–Emden equation**: ${1\over\xi^2} {d \over d\xi} \left(\xi^2 {d(D_n) \over d\xi}\right) = −D_n^n$
  * Where the **polytropic index** $n : \gamma \equiv {n+1 \over n}$
  * TODO: too complicated

### Main sequence

* Vast majority of stars have H mass fraction $X \approx 0.7$ and metal mass fraction $0 \lesssim Z \lesssim 0.03$
* Changes in core composition affects observed surface features
* Very light stars ($M \lesssim 0.08 M_\odot$) are not hot enough to let fusion
  stabilize against gravitational contraction
  * Highly opaque and fully convective
* Lower-initiation-energy PP chain dominates for low-mass stars
  * Shallow core thermal gradient leads to radiative core
  * High shell opacity leads to convective shell
* Highly-temperature-dependent CNO cycle dominates for high-mass stars ($M \gtrsim 1.2 M_\odot$)
  * Steep core thermal gradient leads to convective core
  * Low shell opacity leads to radiative shell
* Very massive stars ($M \gtrsim 90 M_\odot$) have rapid core thermal oscillations
  affecting fusion rates
* Very massive stars may also have radiation pressure exceed gas pressure at
  outer layers, with maximum stable luminosity given by **Eddington limit**:
  $L ≤ {4\pi GcM\over\bar\kappa}$
* Main-sequence lifetimes decrease with increasing luminosity
