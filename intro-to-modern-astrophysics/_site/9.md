## 9. Stellar Atmospheres

* Line blanketing: dense series of metallic absorption lines significantly
  decrease intensity relative to ideal blackbody at certain wavelengths

### Radiation field

* Radiation energy originates from thermonuclear reactions,
  gravitational contraction, and core cooling
* But observed light comes from gasses in atmosphere, not the opaque interior
* Temperature, density, and composition of atmospheric layers determine
  spectral features
* Specific ray intensity:
  $I(\lambda) \;d\lambda \equiv {\partial I\over\partial\lambda} = {{\partial E \over \partial\lambda} d\lambda  \over d\lambda \;dt\;dA \cos \theta \;d\Omega }$,
  power transmitted at a certain wavelength within a certain solid angle
* Mean intensity $\langle I(\lambda) \rangle = I(\lambda)$ for isotropic field; $= B(\lambda)$ for blackbody
* Specific energy density $u(\lambda) \;d\lambda = {4\pi\over c} \langle I(\lambda) \rangle \;d\lambda$
  * Total energy density for blackbody $u = {4\sigma T^4 \over c}$
  * Blackbody radiation pressure $P = {u\over3}$
* Specific radiative flux
  $F(\lambda) \;d\lambda = \int I(\lambda) \;d\lambda \cos \theta \;d\Omega$,
  net energy at a certain wavelength flowing towards one single direction
* For a resolved source, specific ray intensity is measured,
  thus detector distance does not affect measured intensity,
  though the angular size decreases
* For an unresolved source, specific radiative flux is measured,
  falling off with ${1\over r^2}$

### Temperature

* **Mean free path** $l = {1\over n\sigma}$,
  * Average distance traveled by particles and photonsbetween collisions
  * Where $n$ is atomic number density and $\sigma \equiv \pi(2a_0)^2$ is collision cross section
* Multiple descriptions of temperature:
  * **Effective temperature**: obtained from the Stefan–Boltzmann law
  * **Excitation temperature**: defined by the Boltzmann equation
  * **Ionization temperature**: defined by the Saha equation
  * **Kinetic temperature**: defined by the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution
  * **Color temperature**: defined by fitting the Planck function on the spectrum
* Effective temperature is a global descriptor;
  rest apply locally, varying by gas location and other conditions
* All local temperature definitions result in the same value
  at thermodynamic equilibrium
* **Local thermodynamic equilibrium** (LTE) occurs when temperature change is
  very gradual compared to the mean free path length: $H \ll L$
  * Temperature scale height $H(T) \equiv {T \over \lvert{ dT \over dr }\rvert}$

### Opacity

* Both scattering and pure absorption reduce the intensity of directed light:
  $\;dI = −\kappa\rho I \;ds$
  * Where absorption coefficient (opacity) $\kappa$ is dependent on
    ray wavelength and gas composition, density, and temperature
* Characteristic distance $l = {1\over k\rho}$ is equivalent to main free path for photons
* Pure absorption decreases intensity exponentially: $I = I_0 e^{−\tau}$
  * Where $\tau$ is **optical depth** with $d\tau = −\kappa\rho \;ds$
* Optical depth is equivalent to the number of mean free path lengths along the
  path of a ray; gas is “**optically thick**” if $\tau \gg 1$, “**optically thin**” if $\tau \ll 1$
* **Balmer jump**: opacity of stellar material suddenly increases for wavelengths
  below the ionization energy of H I in the first excited state
* Sources of opacity classified by initial and final quantum states of the
  interacting electrons:
  * **Bound–bound transitions** (excitation and de-excitation)
    * Small except for wavelengths corresponding to specific excitation energies;
    * If de-excitation returns to the initial state through emission,
      the photon is essentially scattered
    * If multiple photons are emitted from one absorption, the average photon
      energy is reduced
    * If de-excitation is instead triggered by collision, then the energy is
      converted into kinetic/thermal
  * **Bound-free absorption** (photoionization) and **free–bound emission** (recombination)
    * Wavelength-dependent cross section comparable to that of collisions
    * Adds to continuum opacity, as any photon above an electron’s
      ionization energy may be absorbed
    * Recombination emits one or more photons,
      again reducing average photon energy and scattering
  * **Free–free absorption** and **bremsstrahlung** (“braking radiation”) emission
    * Free electron gains speed from absorption, or loses speed from emission
    * Must take place next to an ion to conserve both energy and momentum
    * Adds to continuum opacity
  * **Free electron** (Thomson) scattering
    * Photon is scattered when the electron is made to oscillate in its EM field
    * Very tiny wavelength-independent cross section
    * Only dominates in stellar interiors and the hottest atmospheres,
      where near-total ionization eliminates bound-electron processes
  * **Loosely-bound electron** (Compton/Rayleigh) scattering
    * Compton if $\lambda \ll a_0$;
      very small change in scattered photon wavelength, much like Thomson
    * Rayleigh if $\lambda \gg a_0$;
      proportional to ${1 \over \lambda^4}$,
      so only significant in UV for supergiant stars’ extended envelopes,
      cool main-sequence stars, and planet atmospheres
* Electron scattering and photoionization of He are primary sources of continuum opacity
  for type O
* Photoionization of H and free–free absorption primary sources for types B–A
* Photoionization of H$^-$ is primary source for type F0 and cooler
  * Very low binding energy of 0.754 eV ($\lambda = 1640 \text{ nm}$) for bound–free opacity
  * Also contributes to free–free absorption at longer wavelengths
* Molecules survive in planetary and cooler stellar atmospheres
  * High opacity from large number of discrete absorption lines
  * May break apart during absorption through photodissociation
* Rosseland mean opacity: weighted harmonic mean of opacity across all wavelengths,
  accounting for rate of change of the blackbody spectrum with temperature;
  ${1\over\kappa} \equiv {\int {1\over\kappa_\nu} {\partial B_\nu \over \partial T} \;d\nu \over \int {\partial B_\nu \over \partial T} \;d\nu }$
  * Obeys **Kramer’s opacity law**: $\kappa \propto {\rho\over T^{3.5}}$
  * No analytic solution, but approximations exist for bound–free and free–free opacities
  * $\kappa_\text{bf} \propto {g_\text{bf} \over t} {Z (1+X) \rho \over T^{3.5}}, k_\text{ff} \propto g_\text{ff} {(1−Z)(1+X) \rho \over T^{3.5}}$
    * $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are **mass fractions** of H, He, and metals respectively
    * $g_\text{bf}$ and $g_\text{ff}$ are **Gaunt factors** correcting for quantum effects; ~1 for visible and UV
    * t is the **guillotine factor**, typically ranging 1–100

### Radiative transfer

* No net energy change occurs in any layer of a star that is in steady-state equilibrium
* Emission processes complement each of the primary absorption processes,
  resulting in randomly-directed scattering
* Specific intensity: $dI = −\kappa\rho I \;ds + j\rho \;ds$
  * Where $\kappa$ is the absorption and $j$ is the emission coefficient; both are $\lambda$-dependent
* Equation of radiative transfer: $−{1\over\kappa\rho} {dI\over ds} = {dI\over d\tau} = I − S$
  * Where source function: $S \equiv {j\over\kappa}$
  * Expresses how light beam composition tends to resemble the local source of photons
* In local thermodynamic equilibrium, $S = B$, the blackbody Planck function
  * Integrating over all wavelengths, $S = B = {\sigma T^4\over\pi}$
  * If $\tau \gg 1, I = B$ as well
* Radiation differential “driving” net radiative flux of photons flowing to the surface:
  ${dP\over d\tau} = −{F\over c}$
* Radiative flux throughout star is constant: $F = \sigma T_\text{eff}^4$
* In a random walk with $N$ steps of average size $I$, $d = l\sqrt N$
* On average, a photon from optical depth $\tau$ needs $\tau^2$ steps to reach the surface
  * Photons from $\tau \approx 1$ may escape without scattering
* **Eddington approximation**: $T^4 \approx {3\over4} T_\text{eff}^4 \left(\tau + {2\over3}\right)$
  * Star has its effective temperature at optical depth $\tau \approx {2\over3}$
  * Average observed photon is emitted from $\tau \approx {2\over3}$, independent of angle
* Higher opacity corresponds to shorter pathlength for the same optical depth,
  thus absorption lines must come from outer, cooler layers
* Limb darkening: line of sight reaches $\tau = {2\over3}$ in cooler, dimmer layers when
  observing closer to the edge of the disk

### Spectral line profile

* Core of line is formed at higher and cooler layer;
  formation descends down to continuum region at wings of the line
* Line is **spectrally thin** if radiant flux $F(\lambda)$ is never 0
* **Equivalent width** $W \equiv \int 1 − {F(\lambda) \over F_0} d\lambda$
  * Where the integrand is the depth of the line at $\lambda$
* Broadening processes:
  * **Natural broadening**: uncertainty principle means momentary occupancy of
    an excited state for small $\Delta t$ amplifies uncertainty of orbital energy
    $\Delta E \approx {\hbar \over \Delta t}$, resulting in uncertainty of wavelength
    $\Delta\lambda \approx {\lambda^2 \over 2\pi c} \left( {1 \over \Delta t_0} + {1 \over \Delta t_1} \right)$, where $\Delta t$ are lifetimes in the two states
  * **Doppler broadening**: random thermodynamic motion results in nonrelativistic Doppler shift
    $\Delta\lambda \approx {2\lambda \over c} \sqrt{2kT \over m}$
    * in giant and supergiant stars, random large-scale turbulence increases to
      $\Delta\lambda \approx {2\lambda \over c} \sqrt{2kT\over m + v^2}$, where $v$ is the most probable turbulence speed
    * coherent mass motions such as rotation, pulsation and mass loss also
      substantial factors
  * **Pressure broadening**: collisions with neutral atoms and pressure from nearby
    ion electrical fields may perturb the orbitals with
    $\Delta\lambda = {\lambda^2 \over \pi c \Delta t_0}$, where $\Delta t_0 \approx {1\over n\sigma\sqrt{2kT \over m} }$ is the average collision time
    * Dependence on atomic number density explains narrower lines of sparser
      giant and supergiant extended atmospheres used for the
      Morgan–Keenan classification
* Damping/**Lorentz profile**: shape of lines from natural and pressure broadening,
  characteristic of radiation from electric charge in damped harmonic motion
* **Voigt profile**: total line profile from both Doppler and damping profiles,
  with Doppler dominating at the core and damping dominating at wings
* **Schuster–Schwarzchild model**: assumes photosphere is a blackbody
  and atoms above it create absorption lines
* Number of atoms involved in absorption per surface area: $fN$
  * Where oscillator strength $f$ is the relative likelihood of each transition,
    and column density $N$ is the area density of absorbing atoms in a column from the surface to the observer
* **Curve of growth** for line width as a function of column density:
  * Initially optically thin core: $W \propto N$
  * Then, saturated core with optically thin wings: $W \propto \sqrt{\ln N}$
  * For high $N$, pressure-broadening profile dominates wings: $W \propto \sqrt N$
* Applying Boltzmann and Saha equations to curve of growth finds total number of atoms above continuum layer
  * Applying Boltzmann equation also finds excitation temperature
  * Applying Saha equation also finds either e$^-$ pressure or ionization temperature from the other

### Computer modeling

* Construction of an atmospheric model with extensive physics fine-tuned to observations
  can provide information on line profile, chemical composition, effective temperature,
  surface gravity, etc
