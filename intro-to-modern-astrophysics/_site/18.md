## 18. Closed Binary Star Systems

### Gravitation

* Large majority of stars are in multi-star systems, but most of them are **detached binaries**: sufficiently far apart ($a\gg\max(R_1, R_2)$) to evolve independently
* In close systems ($a\lesssim\max(R_1,R_2)$), tidal forces induce pulsation, dissipating orbital and rotational energy until tidal lock is achieved
* In corotating center-of-mass reference frame, effective gravitational potential $\Phi=-G\left({M_1\over s_1}+{M_2\over s_2}\right)-{\omega^2r^2\over 2}$
  * Where $s_1$ and $s_2$ are distances to the two masses, and angular frequence $\omega={G(M_1+M_2)\over a^3}$
* Hydrostatic equilibrium ensures constant pressure and density along **equipotential surfaces**; expanding stars fill successively larger ones
* Gravitational and centrifugal forces balance at **Lagragian points**, where $\vec F=-m\nabla\Phi=0$
  * Local minima are stable; local maxima and saddle-points are unstable
* Inner Lagrangian point $L_1$ located between the masses with distances to each $\lbrace \ell_1, \ell_2 \rbrace \approx a\left({1\over2}\pm0.227\log_{10}{M_1\over M_2}\right)$
  * Equipotential surfaces meet at $L_1$ as teardrop-shaped **Roche lobes**
* **Semidetached binary**: secondary star (with $M_2$ not necessarily more massive) fills its Roche lobe and loses mass to the companion primary star
* **Contact binary**: both stars fill (or even expand beyond) their Roche lobes and share a common atmospheric envelope
* **Mass transfer rate** $\dot M\approx\pi R\rho d\sqrt{3kT\over m_\text{H}}$
  * Where $R$ is maximum Roche lobe radius and $d$ is overfill distance
  * Changes orbital period and orbital separation ${da\over dt}=2a\dot M_1{M_1-M_2\over M_1M_2}$
* Infalling material release $\dot E={GM\dot M\over R}$, or $\sim20\%$ of rest mass in energy when falling into neutron stars, compared to $\lesssim1\%$ falling into white dwarfs

### Accretion disks

* If primary star of semidetached binary has radius $r\lesssim0.05a$, mass stream from secondary will miss its surface and enter orbit at $r_0=a\left(\ell_1\over a\right)^4\left(1+{M_2\over M_1}\right)$
* Accretion disk develops; further mass stream impacts at disk **hot spot**
* Viscosity converts orbital kinetic energy into random thermal motion, causing disk mass to inspiral and eventually fall to surface
  * Source of strong viscosity poorly understood; possibly convection turbulence or magnetohydrodynamic instabilities
* Radius $R_\text{disk}\approx2r_0$ due to conservation of angular momentum: most disk material spiral inward while some spiral outward 
* If optically thick, temperature $T_\text{disk}(r)=T_\text{0}\sqrt[4]{\left(R\over r\right)^3 \left(1-\sqrt{R-r}\right) }$
  * Where characteric temperature $T_0\equiv\sqrt[4]{3GM\dot M\over 8\pi\sigma R^3}\approx 2\max (T_\text{disk})$
* Luminosity $L_\text{disk}={GM\dot M\over 2R}={1\over2}\dot E$, with the other half delivered to the primary star
  * White dwarf $L_\text{disk}\approx0.22\,L_\odot$, emitting primarily in UV
  * Neutron star $L_\text{disk}\approx2400\,L_\odot$, emitting primarily in X-ray
* Observational evidence: light curves of eclipsing binaries show steadily rising temperatures toward center, and hot spot on one side of disk

### Classification

* **Algols**: two main-sequence or subgiant stars in semidetached binary
  * **W Serpens stars**: active Algols, studied for rapid stages of stellar and binary evolution
  * Mass loss may enrich interstellar medium
* **RS Canum Venaticorum stars** & **BY Draconis stars**: chromospherically active binaries with enhanced magnetic activity; studied for dynamo mechanism in cool (type F and later) stars
* **W Ursae Majoris contact systems**: short-period ($0.2\sim0.8$ days) contact binaries with very high magnetic activity; studied for dynamo mechanism at extreme levels
  * Magnetic braking may coalesce them into single stars 
* **Cataclysmic variables** (CV) and **nova-like binaries**: white dwarfs and M-type stars in short-period semidetached binaries; studied for final stages of stellar evolution and accretion phenomena
* **X-ray binaries**: neutron stars or black holes accreting gas from nondegenerate companions and emitting energetic X-rays $L\gt10^{28}$ W; evidence for existence of black holes
* **$\zeta$ Aurigae systems** & **VV Cephei systems**: G–M-type supergiants and $\sim$B-type companions in long-period interacting binaries; eclipses studied for supergiant atmospheric properties
  * Became interacting binaries when more massive star evolved into supergiant
* **Symbiotic binaries**: M-type giants and hot white dwarf/subdwarf/low-mass main-sequence companions in long-period ($200\sim1500$ days) interacting binaries; studied for accretion of cool wind onto hot companion
* **Barium binaries** & **S-star binaries**: K/M-type giants with cool white dwarf companions that once transferred them nuclear-processed gas; studied for nucleosynthesis and mass loss in evolved stars
* **Post-common-envelope binaries**: cool secondaries and hot white dwarf/subdwarf companions; studied for rapid stages of stellar evolution
* AM Herculis stars / **polars**: semidetached binaries containing white dwarfs with $B\sim2000$ T
  * Magnetic torque tidally locks both stars and forms a narrow accretion column with a $\sim10^8$ K shock front emitting hard X-ray at the base
  * Photosphere re-emit some hard X-ray as soft X-ray and UV light
  * Nonrelativistic electrons in white dwarf magnetosphere also emit visible-light cyclotron radiation
* DQ Herculis stars / **intermediate polars**: far-apart or weakly magnetic polars missing synchronous rotation but having some accretion flow disruption

### Cataclysmic variable evolution

* Let Star 1 and Star 2 be main-sequence stars in a long-period (months to years) detached binary with $M_1>M_2$
* Binary semidetached as Star 1, evolving more rapidly, overflows its Roche lobe after reaching giant/supergiant phase
  * Mass transfer where $M_1>M_2$ and $\dot M<0$ enters positive feedback loop with shrinking separation and Roche lobe
* **First common envelope stage**: binary contacts, transferring angular momentum onto common envelope and spiralling inward
  * May turn into blue straggler if stellar cores merge
* Otherwise, binary detaches as envelope is eventually ejected and Star 1 cools to a white dwarf
* Binary again semidetached as Star 2 reaches giant phase
  * Mass transfer where $M_1 > M_2$ and $\dot M>0$ faces negative feedback with expanding separation and Roche lobe
  * Transfer only maintained if secondary expands faster than Roche lobe  or if stellar winds remove sufficient angular momentum
* **Second common envelope stage**: suppose mass transfer continues, binary contacts again and spiral further inward, becoming a **cataclysmic variable**

### Cataclysmic variables

* $\sim0.86\, M_\odot$ white dwarf primary and less massive main-sequence (type G or later) secondary in periods mostly ranging 78 minutes $\sim$ 12 hours
  * Gap in periods between $1.5\sim3.25$ hours possibly due to abrupt change in angular momentum transfer
* Long quiescent intervals punctuated by luminous outbursts, likely due to sudden increases in mass flow rate
* Otherwise cool, low-mass, emission-lines-producing accretion disk becomes optically thick with absorption lines during brightening
* **Dwarf novae**: outbursts increase luminosity by $2\sim6$ magnitudes for $5\sim20$ days; separated by quiescent intervals of $30\sim300$ days
  * Visible wavelengths precede UV in brightening by $\sim1$ day, indicating outbursts start in cooler, outer disk and spread inward
  * Mass transfer rate increases $\sim100\times$ during outburst, possibly due to instability in secondary star or accretion disk
  * H partial ionization zone could dam up in secondary and propel material past $L_1$, or dam up in disk and increase viscosity, causing material to fall
* **Classical novae**: outbursts increase luminosity by $7\sim20$ magnitudes
  * Luminosity initially rises rapidly, with a brief standstill $\sim2$ magnitudes from maximum
  * **Fast novae** take weeks to dim by 2 visual magnitudes from maximum; **slow novae** take $\sim100$ days, but are also $\sim3$ visual magnitudes dimmer at maximum
  * Bolumetric magnitude remain roughly constant for months: dimming in visual band offset by brightening, first in UV, then in IR 
  * Accompanied by ejection of $10^{-5}\sim10^{-4}\,M_\odot$ of hot gasses at $\sim10^3$ km/s, with slow novae ejecting them $\sim3\times$ slower
  * System returns to pre-eruption luminosity of $M_V\sim4.5$ after decades

### Classical nova cycle

* White dwarf in semidetached binary accretes H-rich gas onto surface at $10^{-8}\sim10^{-9}\, M_\odot$/year
* Convection enriches H shell with surface C, N, and O; pressure heats shell and turns base degenerate
* Accumulation of $10^{-4}\sim10^{-5}\, M_\odot$ of H at $\sim10^6$ K triggers runaway CNO cycle at base of shell, reaching $\sim10^8$ K before electrons there are lifted from degeneracy
* **Hydrodynamic ejection phase**, dominant for fast novae: once luminosity exceeds Eddington limit, radiation pressure lifts $\sim10\%$ of H layer into space
* **Hydrostatic burning phase**, dominant or slow novae: CNO cycle stabilizes near Eddington limit and hydrostatic equilibrium is reached; inert layer above H-burning shell becomes fully convective and expands to $\sim10^6$ km
* **Fireball expansion phase**: hydrodynamically ejected gasses form optically thick, glowing “fireball” with $T\approx6000\sim10\,000$ K, resembling a type A/F supergiant; reaches maximum visual brightness in a few days, then becomes optically thin
* **Optically thin phase**: transparent ejecta reveal hydrostatically-burning white dwarf, resembling a blue horizontal-branch giant
* **Dust formation phase**: as $T$ falls below $\lesssim1000$ K, carbon in ejecta condense and form dust shell; turns optically thick $\sim50\%$ of the time and re-radiates energy from white dwarf in IR

### Type Ia supernovae

* Destruction of white dwarf near Chandrasekhar limit
* Maximum brightness very consistently $M_B\approx M_V\approx-19.3\pm0.3$
* Peak brightness–rate of decline relation allow accurate distance measurements to faraway host galaxies
  * Critical for discovery of dack energy
* Absence of H lines indicates evolved nature; P-Cygni profile indicates mass loss; blueshifted absorption lines indicate ejecta speeds $\gtrsim10^4$ km/s $\approx0.1c$
* **Dobule-degenerate models**: two white dwarfs
  * Radiation of gravitational waves cause orbits to decay
  * Larger and less massive secondary eventually spills over Roche lobe, breaking into thick disk for the primary to accrete
  * As primary nears Chandrasekhar limit, nuclear reactions ignite in deep interior and destroy it
  * Roughly predict the right number of mergers, but ignitions, if off-center, may result in neutron stars instead of supernovae, and predictions of heavy element abundances are inconsistent with spectra
* **Single-degenerate models**: a C–O white dwarf and an evolving star companion
  * Helium-triggered model: He gas from secondary settle on surface with base becoming degenerate; He flash sends shockwave into interior and ignites degenerate C and O
  * Direct ignition model: multiple independent ignitions of C and O occur in interior as star nears Chandrasekhar limit
  * Require fine-tuning rate of accretion to prevent dwarf novae or classical novae from taking place instead
* Unclear if direct ignition single- and double-degenerate models result in subsonic deflagaration or supersonic detonation in shock front

### Neutron star binary formation processes

* Supernova in existing binary: unbinds system if $\ge{1\over2}$ of total mass is ejected; otherwise, neutron star or black hole now in binary
* **Tidal capture**: neutron star passing within $1\sim3\,R_\text{companion}$ loses significant kinetic energy to tidal dampening and becomes gravitationally bound; most effective in densely populated regions
* Disruption of multi-star system: neutron star transfers kinetic energy to another star, ejecting that star while itself is captured
* Direct collision with giant: neutron star penetrates star and enters subsurface orbit with its degenerate core, becoming a **Thorne–Żytkow object** (TŻO); envelope is then quickly expelled, producing neutron star–white dwarf binary

### X-ray binaries

* **Low-mass X-ray binaries** (LMXB): short orbital periods ($11$ minutes $\sim35$ days) with low-mass, mostly cool secondary stars
* **Massive X-ray binaries** (MXRB): relatively longer orbital periods ( $0.2\sim580$ days) with O and B giants and supergiants
* **Alfvén radius** $r_A = \sqrt[7]{8\pi^2 B^4 R^{12}\over \mu_0 G M \dot M^2}$
  * Where magnetic energy density $u_m = {1\over2\mu_0}B^2\propto1/r^6$ equals kinetic energy density $u_K = {1\over2}\rho v^2$
* Below disruption radius $r_d\approx0.5r_A$, ionized gas is channeled onto magnetic poles instead of impacting surface
  * If $r_d\approx r_\text{orbit}$, magnetic field prevents formation of disk and confines accretion to narrow streams directed towards poles
  * If $r_d\lesssim r_\text{disk}$, magnetic field only distrupts accretion disk near star surface
  * Polar-like accretion columns and shock fronts formed above poles
* **X-ray burster**: LMXB with weak magnetic field
  * Matter settling on surface of neutron star with weak magnetic field ($\ll10^8$ T) periodically ignites H, He, then possibly C fusion
  * He fusion extremely explosive and releases $\sim10^{32}$ J in seconds, predominantly in X-ray
  * Accretion disk re-emits some X-ray in visible light seconds after the burst
* Companion stars of LMXBs become white dwarfs without disturbing the system 
* **Binary X-ray pulsar**: strong magnetic field; $\sim50\%$ of XMRBs
  * Matter accreting on poles of neutron star release up to $\sim10^{31}$ W, predominantly in X-ray
  * Near-Eddington-limit radiation elevates shock front, resulting in large solid angle for emission
  * Period slowly speeding up from transfer of accreting matter’s angular momentum via magnetic torques
    * Pulse arrival times vary with phase of orbit, allowing determination of orbital radius
  * Misalignment of magnetic and rotation axes may allow eclipsing of pulses by companion, and thereby complete determination of masses and radii in the system
* Some MXRBs ($\gtrsim3\, M_\odot$) may contain a stellar-mass black hole
  * Most candidates lack developed accretion disks, making mass determination of compact object difficult
  * A0620–00: an **X-ray nova** with sporatic accretion and a $3.82\pm0.24\, M_\odot$ black hole
  * Cygnus X-1: bright MXRB with a $>3.4\, M_\odot$ black hole
  * SS 433: three emission lines, with two posessing significant Doppler shifts attributed to relativistic jets of a precessing accretion disk from a neutron star or black hole

### X-ray binary remnants

* Companion stars of MXRBs may go supernova, either unbinding the system or creating a double neutron star / neutron star–black hole binary
* **Millisecond radio pulsars**: spun up by accretion as LMXBs, but small fraction are missing white dwarf companions
* **Black widow pulsar**: if pulsar beam close to equator, white dwarf may be evaporated
* **Double neutron star binaries**: precise measurements on orbital decay of **Hulse–Taylor pulsar** (PSR 1913+16) confirmed existence of gravitational waves
* **Short–hard gamma ray bursts**: merger of two neutron stars or neutron star and black hole
