## 12. The Interstellar Medium and Star Formation

### Interstellar medium (ISM)

* Gas and dust between the stars
* 70% H, ~30% He, rest metals (C, Si, etc)
* Used in star formation; returned by stellar winds and explosive events

### Dust

* ~1% of molecular clouds by mass, but significant in light absorption and cloud chemistry
* Likely facilitate formation of many molecules besides H$_2$,
  including solid CO, H$_2$O, etc that give the grains icy mantles
* Formed in dense envelopes of very cool stars, from supernovae and stellar winds
* Unexpected abundance of large grains an area of active research
* Responsible for **interstellar extinction**, a $\lambda$-dependent increase in apparent magnitude
  from scattering and absorption of starlight: $A = \Delta m$
  * Approximately equal to the optical depth: $A \approx 1.086\tau$
  * Visual band extinction commonly used as reference: $A_V$
* **Mie theory** applies to IR–visible range
  * Shorter wavelengths are scattered more (though spectral lines go unaltered),
    causing interstellar reddening along direct line of sight,
    and blue tones in reflection nebulae
  * Extinction coefficient: $Q(\lambda) \equiv {\sigma(\lambda)\over\sigma_g}$
  * With dust grain radius: $r$ such that grain cross section: $\sigma_g = \pi r^2$
  * Where photon cross section approaches 0 for $\lambda \gg r$ and a constant for $\lambda \ll r$:
    $\sigma(\lambda) \propto {r^3\over\lambda}$ for $\lambda \gtrsim r$, and $\sigma(\lambda) \propto r^2$ for $\lambda \ll r$
* Color excesses relative to Mie prediction grow for shorter wavelengths
* Bump at 217.5 nm corresponding to resonance of graphite,
  along with IR emission bands corresponding to C–C and C–H bond vibrations,
  indicate presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  (PAHs)
* Near-IR absorption bands indicate presence of silicate grains
* Slight, $\lambda$-dependent polarization due to anisotropic, somewhat aligned dust grains;
  alignment most likely due to interactions with a weak magnetic field

### Hydrogen

* **21-cm line**: anti-aligned spins ↑↓ has slightly less energy than aligned spins ↑↑
  * Very stable, “forbidden” transition that takes millions of years
    on average to occur per atom
  * Only possible (although still rare) for H I in low-density diffuse ISM
  * Optically thin, thus optical depth $\propto$ H column density
* H$_2$ hard to directly observe except for rovibrational bands;
  tracer molecules and their isotopomers used instead
* Optically thick dust shields H$_2$ from UV photodissociation,
  as well as enhancing H$_2$ formation
* H I generally proportional in number to dust when $A_V \lesssim 1$;
  displaced by H$_2$ when dust becomes optically thick
* Shells of H I clouds surround molecular clouds of H$_2$

### Interstellar cloud structure

* Most diffuse ISM are hydrogen clouds of ground state H I,
  only absorbing UV photons and emitting in 21-cm line
* Transluscent/**diffuse molecular clouds**:
  irregularly shaped; similar in conditions to H I clouds;
  primarily atomic H with regional concentrations of H$_2$
* **Giant molecular clouds** (GMCs): enormous complexes with clumpy structure
  * Contains slightly denser dark cloud complexes, denser clumps and dense cores,
    and very dense, star-forming hot cores
* **Bok globules**:
  almost-spherical clouds located outside of larger molecular complexes;
  possibly dense cores stripped of surrounding gas by stellar winds

### Interstellar cloud heating and cooling

* Primarily heated by cosmic ray protons
  * $E$ ranges $10–10^{14}$ MeV, with $10^3–10^8$ MeV common
  * Ionizes H and H$_2$, ejecting e$^-$’s that distribute thermal energy
    throughout ISM via collisions with molecules
* Also heated by UV starlight ionizing C and dust grains,
  X-ray starlight ionizing H, dust grains absorbing starlight,
  and shocks from supernovae and strong stellar winds
* Primarily cooled by IR radiation from post-collision de-excitations,
  particularly those of C$^+$ and CO after colliding with H and H$_2$, respectively

### Protostar formation

* **Protostars**: pre-nuclear-burning objects formed from molecular clouds
* Deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium means imbalance in the virial theorem:
  $2K < |U|$ ⇒ gravitational collapse
* Jeans criterion, minimum necessary for spontaneous collapse:
  * **Jeans mass** $M \approx \sqrt{ \left(5kT \over G\mu\right)^3 {3\over4\pi\rho_0} }$
  * **Jeans length** $R \approx \sqrt{ 15kT \over 4\pi G\mu\rho_0}$
  * Neglecting rotation, turbulence, magnetic fields,
    and pressure of surrounding gas
* Bonnor–Ebert criterion accounts for external pressure $P_0$
  * **Bonnor–Ebert mass**: $M = { c_BE v^4 \over \sqrt{P_0 G^3} }$
  * Where isothermal sound speed $v \equiv \sqrt{kT\over\mu}$,
    and constant $c_\text{BE} \approx 1.18$
* Low-pressure, optically thin first phase of collapse essentially isothermal and in free-fall
  * Free-fall timescale $t = \sqrt{3\pi \over 32G\rho_0}$
* **Homologous collapse**:
  Initially uniform spherical cloud would uniformly contract and condense
* Inside-out collapse:
  Somewhat centrally condensed cloud will have
  shorter free-fall time and thus condense faster near center
* Significant rotation results in disk-like structure
* Magnetic pressure keeps clouds balanced; eddy braking slows collapse
  * Critical mass with magnetic pressure: $M = {c_B \pi R^2 B \over \sqrt G}$
  * Supercritical mass achieved by merger of subcritical clouds,
    or (more commonly) regional lessening of magnetic field
* **Ambipolar diffusion**: neutral particles drift gravitationally,
  but are slowed by collisions with magnetically-frozen charged particles
* **Fragmentation**: increasing density with constant $T$ reduces Jeans mass,
  causing density inhomogeneities to collapse locally,
  forming large numbers of small protostars in place of a single massive one
* **Initial mass function** (IMF):
  number of stars formed per mass interval strongly mass-dependent,
  with abundance of low-mass stars
* Increasing density purely adiabatically increases Jeans mass
* Fragmentation stops as center becomes optically thick when $\sim10^{-10} \text{ kg}\;\text{m}^{-3}$,
  trapping radiation and making collapse more adiabatic
* Central region reaches near hydrostatic equilibrium and becomes protostar
  * Larger dust photosphere has radius and effective temperature where $\tau = {2\over3}$,
    putting star on H–R diagram
  * ~10 AU wide for collapse from $1 M_\odot$ cloud

### Protostar evolution

* Surrounding material still in free-fall until meeting protostellar core,
  releasing significant kinetic energy at shock front as they slow from
  supersonic speeds
  * Emits blackbody radiation predominantly in IR
  * Luminosity increases with temperature for several thousand years
* Dust begins to vaporize and opacity drops ~1000 K
  * Substatially reduces photosphere radius to nearly the surface of the
    hydrostatic core
  * Increases effective temperature with little change in luminosity
* $\text{H}_2$ dissociates ~2000 K,
  absorbing thermal energy otherwise used to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium,
  triggering second collapse
* Core radius decreases to $\sim1.3 R_\odot$ for collapse from $1 M_\odot$ cloud, while
  core mass $\ll 1 M_\odot$, indicating ongoing accretion at a second shock front
* Hot core begins burning deuterium ($^2_1\text{H}$), producing ~60% of luminosity,
  which stays roughly constant
* Deuterium burn-out leads to sharp drop in luminosity with small decrease
  in effective temperature, leading to pre-main-sequence star

### Protostar observation

* Direct observation shielded by thick dust of molecular cloud,
  and made rare by relatively short free-fall time
* Small IR sources embedded in dense cores or Bok globules indicate collapse
* Infalling material around embedded IR objects show twin spectral splitting
  from Doppler effect

### Pre-main-sequence evolution

* Increasing temperatures lead to H$^-$ opacity dominating in outer layers,
  creating envelope to become deeply convective
* **Hayashi track**: convection constrains H–R path to near vertical line
  * Luminosity decreases with slight increase in temperature
    as protostar slows collapse and reaches hydrostatic equilibrium
* Formation of $\sim1 M_\odot$ stars:
  * Completely convective from high H$^-$ opacity for the first $\sim10^6$ years of collapse,
    slowed little by scarce deuterium burning
  * Rising central temperature decreases opacity and creates expanding radiative core
  * Core begins generating energy from first steps in the
      PP I chain ($2 {\;}^1_1\text{H} \to {\;}^3_2\text{He}$) and CNO cycle ($^{12}_6\text{C} + {\;}^1_1\text{H} \to ^{14}_7\text{N}$),
  * Surface luminosity increases with temperature again and moves star off Hayashi track
  * Core burning comes to increasingly dominate luminosity generation
  * CNO reactions give core steep temperature gradient and some convection
  * Core expansion from intense nuclear energy production expends gravitational energy,
    lowering luminosity and effective temperature to main-sequence values
  * After exhaustion of $^{12}_6$C for CNO, core reaches temperature
    for hydrostatic hydrogen burning via the full PP I chain
* Formation of $\lesssim 0.5 M_\odot$ stars:
  * Central temperature never reaches efficient $^{12}_6$C-burning temperatures
    for upward branch between Hayashi track and main sequence
  * Fully convection: temperature stays sufficiently low and opacity sufficiently high
    to never develop radiative core
* Formation of brown dwarfs ($0.013 \sim 0.072 M_\odot$):
  * Low nuclear burning rate cannot form main-sequence star
  * $\text{Li}$ burning $\gtrsim 0.06 M_\odot$
  * Deuterium burning $\gtrsim 0.013 M_\odot$ (~13 Jupiter masses)
  * Spectral types L and T
* Formation of massive stars:
  * High central temperatures leads to early, high-luminosity departure from Hayashi track
  * Evolve nearly horizontally across H–R diagram
  * Full CNO cycle becomes dominant H-burning mechanism,
    with steep thermal gradient keeping core convective
* **Zero-age main sequence** (ZAMS): when stars begin equilibrium hydrogen burning

### Stellar formation effects on medium

* **OB associations**: star groups dominated by O and B main-sequence stars
* Massive O and B protostars will first vaporize surrounding dust,
  then dissociate molecules, and finally ionize immediate surroundings
  into an $\text{H II}$ region within an $\text{H I}$ region
* **$\text{H II}$ regions**: $\text{H I}$ ionized into $\text{H II}$ by protostar UV radiation fluoresce in visible light
  during recombination, creating emission nebulae
  in the visible spectrum during recombination
  * **Strömgren radius** of $\text{H II}$ region: $r \approx \sqrt[3]{3N \over 4\pi\alpha n^2}$
  * Where $N$ is rate of ionizing photon production,
    $\alpha$ is likelihood of recombination, and n is number density of protons and electrons
* Radiation pressure from cluster of highly luminous O and B stars
  drives significant mass loss, disperses surrounding cloud (halting star formation),
  and weakens gravitational bound of star group (generally unbinding them)
* **Circumstellar disks**
  * Formed by spin-up of cloud transferring angular momentum away from collapsing star,
    possibly via stellar winds coupled to magnetic fields from within the convection zones
  * Continuous spectrum from reflection of protostar light
  * May be accretion or debris disks, possibly forming protoplanets
  * **Proplyds**: protoplanetary disks $\gtrsim 10^{25} \text{ kg}$
* **Herbig–Haro objects**:
  narrow beams of supersonic gas jets ejected from poles of young protostars
  * Collision with ISM results in excitations, producing bright emission lines
* **T Tauri stars**:
  low-mass ($0.5\sim2 M_\odot$) pre-main-sequence objects in intermediate phase
  between IR source and main-sequence star
  * Large irregular variations in luminosity with timescales ~ days
  * Strong H, Ca II, and Fe emission and Li absorption
  * Often forbidden [O I] and [S II] indicative of extremely low gas densities
  * Some lines have a P Cygni profile indicative of significant mass loss $\approx 10^{-8} M_\odot$/year:
    blueshifted absorption trough before an emission peak and
    a redshifted emission tail
  * P Cygni profile sometimes inverts, indicating significant mass accretion in
    a very unstable environment
* **FU Orionis stars**:
  T Tauri stars undergoing extreme mass accretion ($\approx 10^{-4} M_\odot$/year)
  and increase in luminosity ($\gtrsim4$ magnitudes)
  * Circumstellar disk instabilities dump $\sim 0.01 M_\odot$ of material
    onto central star over ~100 years
  * Inner disk outshines centural star by $100–1000\times$
  * May occur to a T Tauri star several times over its lifetime
* **Herbig Ae/Be stars**: type A and B pre-main-sequence stars with strong emission lines

### Modifications to classical model

* Classical model neglects rotation, turbulence, magnetic fields,
  initial inhomogeneities, strong stellar winds, ionizing stellar radiation,
  pressure-free protostellar collapse, likely smaller initial radii,
  and upper limits to massive star accretion,
* Birth line: evolutionary theories with smaller initial radii
  place upper limit on observed protostar luminosity
* Some observations suggest massive starts $\gtrsim 10 M_\odot$ may
  instead form from mergers or with accretion disk
  due to limiting feedback mechanism on non-rotational accretion
* Classical model predicts inverse relation of collapse time and mass,
  implying massive stars would disperse surrounding cloud before
  any low-mass stars can form
