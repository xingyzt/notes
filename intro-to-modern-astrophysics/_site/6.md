## 6. Telescopes

### Basic optics

* **Index of refraction** $n(\lambda) \equiv {c \over \nu}$
* **Snell's law**: $n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2$
* **Lensmaker's formula**: $P = {1\over f} = (n - 1)\left( {1\over R_1} + {1\over R_2} \right)
  $, 
  $P$ is optical power, $f$ is focal length, $R_n$ are radii of curvature
* Focal length is wavelength-independent for mirrors
* A lens projects angular separation onto a plate (focal plane)
* Linear separation of point sources on focal plane increases with focal length:
  ${d\theta \over dy} = {1\over f}$

### Resolution

* Single-slit diffraction of wavefronts through aperture limits resolving power
* **Airy disk**: bright spot around central maximum
* Destructive interference creates minimums: $\sin \theta = {m\lambda\over D}, m = 1, 2, 3, ...$
* Images are “unresolved” when one's central maximum overlaps with
  another's 1st minimum
* **Rayleigh criterion** defines arbitrary min resolvable distance
  of a circular aperture $\theta \equiv {1.22\lambda \over D}$, $D$ is aperture diameter
  * Possible to differentiate sources within Rayleigh criterion through careful
    analysis of diffraction patterns
* **Seeing**: ctual ground-based optical resolution worse than ideal due to
  refraction from atmospheric turbulence, unless corected by **adaptive optics**
* Only lenses suffer from **chromatic aberration**;
  somewhat reduceable with correcting lenses
* Spherical lenses and mirrors suffer from **spherical aberration**;
  mitigated by paraboloids, which are harder to produce
* Paraboloid lenses and mirrors suffer from **coma**: elongation of off-axis images
* **Astigmatism**: different parts of a lens or mirror converge an image
  at different locations; correction may result in curvature of field issues

### Brightness

* Illumination $J \propto {1 \over F^2}$, the amount of light energy per second focused onto a unit
  area of the resolved image
* Focal ratio: $F ≡ {f \over D}$
  * Larger aperture increases resolution and illumination
  * Longer focal length increases image size but decreases illumination
  * For fixed focal ratio, larger telescope diameter increases resolution but
    not illumination

### Optical telescopes

* **Refracting telescope**:
  * Objective lens focus as much light as possible onto the focal plane
  * Sensor is placed on focal plane or eyepiece is placed at its focal length away
  * **Angular magnification** $m = {f_\text{objective} \over f_\text{eye}}$
  * Issues:
    * Lens can only be supported near the edge, so gravity deforms heavy ones
  * Entire volume must be fabricated precisely
  * Slow thermal response and thermal expansion
  * Chromatic aberrations
* **Reflecting telescope**:
  * Replaces refractor’s objective lens with a mirror
  * Minimizes weight, support, and distortion issues,
    esp. with active support system
  * Main issue: Prime focus of the mirror is in the path of the incoming light
    * **Newtonian telescope**: flat diagonal secondary mirror;
      suffers from faraway eyepiece that introduces torque
    * **Cassegrain telescope**: parabolic (or hyperbolic for **Ritchey-Chrétien telescope**) primary mirror;
      secondary mirror (usually convex to increase focal length) reflects back
      through a hole in the primary’s center
    * **Coudé telescope**: mirror system directs light to an instruments room;
      very long focal length
    * **Schmidt telescope**: spheroidal primary mirror minimizing coma;
      correcting lens to remove spherical aberrations;
      provides wide field of view (degrees vs arcminutes) with low distortion
* Mounts:
  * Equatorial: polar axis, easy to adjust, hard to build for massive telecopes
  * Altitude-azimuth: easy to build, generally needs computer adjustments
* **Adaptive optics**: small deformable mirror with many piezoelectric actuators
  counteract atmospheric distortions, constantly calibrated via a guide star
* **Charge-coupled device** (CCD) detects ~100% of incident photons with a linear
  response across wide wavelength and intensity (dynamic) ranges

### Radio telescopes

* Strength measured is spectral flux density $S(\nu)$
* Typical radio source has $S \approx 1 \text{ jansky (Jy)} = 10^{-26}$ W m$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$;
  weak sources ~mJy
* Integrate $S$ over area and bandwidth for total power received
* Long wavelengths require large apertures, but less manufacturing precision
* Addition of other telescopes enables interferometry;
  reduces side lobes and narrows main lobe of antenna sensitivity pattern
* **Interferometry** determines angle of source from phase difference between antennae
* Pointing angle $\theta : \sin \theta = {L\over d}$,
  $L$ is difference in wavefront’s distances to the antennae;
  $d$ is baseline distance between antennae
* **Very long baseline interferometry** (VLBI) can span multiple continents

### IR/UV/X-ray/gamma-ray astronomy

* Water vapor is primary contributor to IR absorption; thus low-humidity
  mountain peaks, balloons and aircraft observatories are used
* IR observation also requires very cold telescopes and detectors
* Glass is opaque to UV; UV telescopes need very precise reflecting surfaces
* X-ray and gamma-ray photons penetrate traditional mirrors;
  instead imaged by **graze-incidence** (near 90° incidence) reflections, or by
  **Bragg scattering** through crystal lattice inteference
