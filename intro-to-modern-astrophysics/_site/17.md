## 17. General Relativity and Black Holes

### General relativity

* Geometric description of how intervals in spacetime are measured in the presence of mass and energy
* “Mass tell spacetime how to curve, spacetime tells mass how to move”
* Spacetime curvature increases distance between points and slow down time
* **Weak equivalence principle**: gravitational charge $m_g$, which determines the force of gravity, is directly proportional to inertial mass $m_i$, which exists even without gravity; thus, every object falls with the same acceleration
* **Principle of equivalence**: All locally inertial (freely falling and nonrotating) frames of reference are physically equivalent, related by the Lorentz transformations between their instantaneous relative velocity
  * Only local, as gravity pulls in different magnitudes and directions in different places
* **Gravitational bending of light**: in free-fall reference frame, photons travel in straight lines; observed from the ground, photons curve down with the inertial frame
* **Gravitational time dilation** and **gravitational redshift**: in free-fall reference frame, upward photons do not lose energy; observed from the ground, the photon took less time and traveled less distance in the inertial frame
  * Time dilates and space streches inside gravitational wells 
  * ${\Delta\nu\over\nu_0}\approx-{gh\over c^2}$ for small $g$
  * ${\Delta t_0\over\Delta t_\infty}={\nu_\infty\over\nu_0}=\sqrt{1-{2GM\over r_0c^2}}\approx 1-{GM\over r_0c^2}$

### Intervals and geodesics

* **Einstein field equations** of form $\mathcal G = -{8\pi G\over c^4} \mathcal T$ calculates the **Einstein tensor** $\mathcal G$, describing the curvature of spacetime, from the **stress–energy tensor** $\mathcal T$, describing the distribution of mass and energy
* **Event** $s$: a point in spacetime with coordinates $(x, y, z, t)$
* **Worldline** $\mathcal W$: path of object moving through spacetime
* **Spacetime interval** $(\Delta s)^2 = c(\Delta t)^2 - (\Delta x)^2 - (\Delta y)^2 - (\Delta z)^2$
  * The “distance” between two events, invariant under Lorentz transformations
  * **Timelike** if $(\Delta s)^2 > 0$
    * Enough time for light to travel between the events
    * Inertial frames exist in which they happen in the same location, separated by **proper time** $\Delta\tau\equiv\Delta s/c$
  * Null/**lightlike** if $(\Delta s)^2 = 0$
    * Only light can travel between the events
  * **Spacelike** if $(\Delta s)^2 < 0$
    * Too much space for light to travel between the events
    * Inertial frames exist in which they happen simultaneously, separated by **proper distance** $\Delta\mathcal L = \sqrt{-(\Delta s)^2}$
* **Light cones**: regions of spacetime with causal (timelike/lightlike) connection to an event
  * **Past light cone**: region of past spacetime whose light can reach the event; everything that could influence the event
  * **Future light cone**: region of future spacetime reachable by light from the event; everything the event could influence
  * Boundaries are **event horizons**, dividing the knowable from the unknowable
* **Metric**: formula for measuring differential distance along worldlines, defining $(ds)^2$ such that $\Delta s(\mathcal W) =\int_{\mathcal W}\sqrt{ds)^2}$
  * **Minkowski metric** for flat spacetime: $(ds)^2 = (c\;dt)^2 - (d\ell)^2$, where $(d\ell)^2=(dx)^2+(dy)^2+(dz)^2 = (dr)^2 + (r\; d\theta)^2 + (r \sin\theta \; d\phi)^2$
  * **Swarzchild metric** for single, nonrotating mass at origin:  $(ds)^2=\left(c\; dt\sqrt{1-{2GM\over rc^2}}\right)^2-\left(dr\over \sqrt{1-{2GM\over rc^2}}\right)^2 - (r\; d\theta)^2 - (r \sin\theta \; d\phi)^2$
    * Time dilation in $dt$ term and streching of space in $dr$ term
* **Coordinate speed** ${d\ell\over dt}$: rate of change of spatial coordinates
* All freely-falling particles follow **geodesics**: the straightest, shortest possible worldlines
  * Massive particles follow timelike geodesics with a locally extremum interval, with either the maximum or minimum $\Delta s$ out of nearby worldlines
    * Ex: orbiting satellites follow maximum interval geodesics in Schwarzchild metric
  * Massless particles follow the **null geodesic** with $\Delta s=0$

### Black holes (BH)

* **Swarzchild radius** $R_S = {2GM\over c^2}$: distance from nonrotating mass where escape speed is $c$
* At $R_S$, proper time $d\tau$ and coordinate speed of light moving radially ${dr\over dt}$ are $0$: nothing ever happens and light appears to freeze
* **Black hole**: star that collapsed within its $R_S$ , with a physical **singularity** ($V=0, \rho\to\infty$) at the center enclosed by an **event horizon** at $R_S$
* From distant observer, objects falling into BH emit increasingly time-dilated and redshifted signals
* From free-falling reference frames, gravitational differential result in tidal stretching
* Below $r<R_S$, nothing can remain at rest and all worldlines converge at singularity
* **No hair theorem**: any black hole can be completely described by its mass, angular momentum, and electric charge
* **Frame dragging**: rotating masses induce rotation in surrounding spacetime; creates **ergosphere** around rotating black holes within which all particles are forced to move in the direction of rotation
* Possible upper limit on angular momentum $L\le{GM^2\over c}$, above which a **naked singularity** would be exposed
* **Stellar-mass black holes** ($3\sim5\,M_\odot$)
  * Formed from direct core-collapse (collapsar), spin-down of neutron star (supranova), or accretion on neutron star from binary companion
* **Intermediate-mass black holes** (IMBH; $10^2\sim10^4\,M_\odot$)
  * Formation process unclear; possibly from collapse of supermassive merged star, or merger of stellar-mass BHs
  * Observed as **ultraluminous X-ray sources** (ULXs), correlated with cores of globular clusters and low-mass galaxies
* **Supermassive black holes** (SMBH; $10^5\sim10^9\, M_\odot$)
  * Formation process unclear; possibly from galaxy mergers, or growth of IMBHs
  * Located at centers of most galaxies
* **Primordial black holes** ($10^{-8}$ kg $\sim10^5\,M_\odot$)
  * May have existed in the earliest instants of the universe
* **Schwarzchild throat** / Einstein–Rosen bridge: vacuum solution of field equations with a tunnel at event horizon of nonrotating BH
  * Collapses before anything can cross
* **Wormhole**: nonvacuum solution to field equations connecting arbitrary points in spacetime with no event horizon and survival tidal forces
  * Requires exotic material (with negative energy density $\rho c^2<0$) to prevent collapse
* **Hawking radiation** $\dot E\propto1/M^2$: pair production near event horizon allows gravitational energy to escape, culminating in high-energy burst of gamma rays and elementary particles at death of black hole
