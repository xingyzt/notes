## 5. Interaction of Light and Matter

* **Fraunhofer lines**: absorption lines in the Solar spectrum

### Kirchoff’s Laws

1. Hot, dense gas/solid  produces continuous, lineless spectrum
2. Hot, diffuse gas produces emission lines
3. Cold, diffuse gas in front of a continuous spectrum source produces
   absorption lines in the spectrum

### Spectrographs

* Produced via diffraction grating: $d \sin \theta = n\lambda$,
  $d$ is grating separation; $n$ is spectral order
* Resolving power ${\lambda\over\Delta\lambda} = nN$,
  $\Delta\lambda$ is smallest resolvable wavelength; $N$ is # of gratings illuminated
* Low−speed Doppler shift approximation: ${\Delta\lambda\over\lambda} = {u \cos \theta\over c}$

### Photoelectric effect

* Shining light onto metal ejects electron with energy proportional to frequency, not intensity
* Max kinetic energy of an ejected electron $K = h\nu − \phi$
* Work function $\phi$ is the metal’s min electron binding energy
* Demonstrates quantization of light into packets of energy $E = h\nu$

### Compton scattering

* Relativistic scattering of electrons by high−energy photons
* Photon loses wavelength $\Delta\lambda = {h(1 − \cos \theta)\over m_ec}$, $m_e = 9.109^{-31} \text{ kg}$

### Bohr’s semiclassical atom

* Assumes quantization of angular momentum $L = \mu v r = n \hbar$,
  $n$ is principle quantum number
* However, still puts electrons in classical circular orbits modeled by
  Coulombic attraction
* Kinetic energy of atom $K = {\mu v^2 \over 2} = {e^2 \over 8 \pi \epsilon_0 r} = {n \hbar^2 \over 2\mu r^2}$
* Allowed orbital radii $r = a_0n^2$,
  **Bohr radius** $a_0 = {4\pi \epsilon_0 \hbar^2 \over \mu e^2} \approx 5.292^{-11} \text{ m}$
* Allowed energy levels: $E = -{E_0 \over n^2}$, $E_0 \approx 13.6 \text{ eV}$

### De Broglie waves

* Generalizes photon wavelength-frequency-momentum relation to all partilces
* $\nu = {E \over h}, \lambda = {h \over p}$

### Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle

* $\Delta x \Delta p \geq {\hbar\over2}$, estimated as $\Delta x \Delta p \approx \hbar$ , equivalent to $\Delta E \Delta t \approx \hbar$
* **Reduced Planck constant**: $\hbar = {h \over 2\pi} = 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot\text{s} = 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \text{ eV}\cdot\text{s}$
* Allows for quantum tunnelling when barrier is within a few wavelengths wide
  * e.x. total internal reflection can be disrupted by placing a another prism sufficiently close to the boundary

### Schrödinger's quantum atom

* Schrödinger equation models particles as probability waves
* Analytically solvable for H with same result as the Bohr atom
* Quantum orbitals are probability density clouds
* Adds additional quantum numbers $l \in [0, n-1]$ and $m_l \in [−l, +l]$
* Allowed angular momentum magnitudes $L = \hbar \sqrt{ l (l + 1) }$
* Allowed angular momentum $z$-components $L_z = \hbar m_l$
* Different orbitals with same $n$ are degenerate
  (i.e. have the same energy) *unless* under a magnetic field

### Normal Zeeman effect

* Previously degenerate orbitals split into slightly different energies
* 3 frequencies: $\nu \in \{ \nu_0, v_0 \pm {eB \over 4\pi\mu} \}$
* Allows detection of magnetic field strength around e.g. starspots
* Even if field is too weak to cleanly split,
  different polarizations are still detectable

### Anomalous Zeeman effect and Spin

* Anomalous Zeeman effect: more complex splitting patterns
* Resulted in discovery of the spin quantum number
* Allowed spin angular momentum magnitudes $S = \hbar{\sqrt3\over2}$
* Allowed spin angular momentum z-component $S_z = \hbar m_s$

### Fermions and bosons

* Dirac's relativistic Schrödinger's equation divided particles
  into fermions and bosons
* Also predicted **antiparticles**: opposite electric changes and magnetic moments
* **Fermions** have spins of $\text{odd} \times {\hbar\over2}$; **Bosons** have spins of $\text{integer} \times \hbar$
* **Pauli exclusion principle**: No two fermions can share the same set
  of 4 quantum numbers $\{n, l, m_l, m_s\}$

### Complex spectra

* Quantum state transitions go from one set of quantum numbers to another
* Selection rules significantly lower the probabilities of certain transitions
* Restrictions: $\Delta l = \pm1, \Delta m_l \in \{ 0, \pm1 \}, m_l$ of orbitals cannot both be 0
* Allowed transitions triggered by collisions or occur spontaneously $\approx 10^{-8} \text{ s}$
* Some **forbidden transitions** occur in very low gas densities
  * e.x. diffuse interstellar medium; outer stellar atmospheres
