## 8. Classification of Stellar Spectra

* Stars emit a continuous spectra (the continuum)
  with absorption lines in certain wavelengths

### Harvard spectral types

* Pickering and Fleming initially labeled alphabetically by strength of H absorption lines
* Different strengths due to different temperatures causing different electron
  ionization levels and orbitals
  * H I (neutral)’s visible spectral (Balmer) lines strongest at A0
    ($T_\text{eff} = 9520$ K)
  * He I (neutral)’s visible spectral lines strongest at B2
    ($T_\text{eff} = 22\,000$ K)
  * Ca II (singly ionized)’s visible spectral lines strongest at K0
    ($T_\text{eff} = 5250$ K)
* Cannon rearranged by temperature (OBAFGKM, O hottest)
  and added decimal subdivisions: A0 hotter than A9
* Additional spectral types for very cool stars and brown dwarfs: **OBAFGKMLT**

### Spectral physics

* Statistical mechanics studies macroscopic behavior of stellar atmospheres
* **Maxwell−Boltzmann velocity distribution** $\rho(v) = \left(m \over 2\pi k T \right)^{3/2} e^{−mv^2/2kT} 4\pi v^2$
  * Restricted to gasses in thermodynamic equilibrium with $\rho \lesssim 1$ km m$^{-3}$
  * Most probable speed $v_\text{mode} = \sqrt{2kT\over m}$
  * Root-mean-square speed $v_\text{RMS} = \sqrt{3kT \over m}$ due to right-skewed exponential tail
* Electrons’ orbital energies are affected by their atoms’ kinetic energies
  through collisions: higher orbitals are less likely to be occupied
* Probability ratio of electron states: ${P(s_1) \over P(s_2)} = e^{−(E_1−E_2) / kT}$
  * As thermal energy $kT \to 0$, $P(\text{ higher energy state }) \to 0$; confined to lowest state
  * As $kT \to \infty$, ${P(s_1) \over P(s_2)} \to 1$; all states are equally likely
* Statistical weights of some energy levels increased by degenerate orbitals
* **Boltzmann equation**, the probability ratio of electron energies:
  ${P(E_1) \over P(E_2)} = {g_1 \over g_2} e^{−(E_1−E_2) / kT}$
  * Where $g$ is the statistical weight, or number of states with that energy
* Balmer lines require exitations from the first excited state $N_2$
* Greater fraction of H I are in the excited state $N_2$ at higher temperatures;
  However, at the same time, significant fractions of H I are ionized to H IIs
* **Partition function**, the number of possible electron states weighted by energy,
  varies by ionization state of the atom, thus affecting the probability of
  atoms at different ionization states: $Z = \sum_j g_j e^{−(E_j−E_1) / kT}$
  * For H I, the ground state (with two orbitals $s=\pm{1\over2}$) dominates for most temperatures: $Z \approx 2$
  * For H II, no electrons means only one possible configuration: $Z = 1$
* **Saha equation**, the probability ratio of ionization states:
  ${N_+ \over N} = {2Z_+ \over n_e Z} \left( 2\pi m_e k T \over h^2 \right)^{3/2} e^{−\chi / kT}$
  * Very sensitive to ionization energy $\chi$, as $kT$ only ranges around 0.5−2 eV
  * Also effected by free electron number density $n$, increased by presence of ionized He II&III
* Combining the Boltzmann and Saha equations shows varying narrow partial ionization
  zones for different atoms and ionization states
  * For H, there is significant fraction of electrons in the first excited state for
    temperatures between 8300−11300 K, matching the peaking of Balmer lines $\sim9900$ K

### Hertzsprung–Russell diagram

* Hertzsprung discovered type G and cooler stars had a range of magnitudes;
  termed the brighter ones giants; Russell termed the dimmer ones dwarfs
* H–R diagram plots absolute magnitude (brighter upward) against
  spectral type (warmer leftward)
* 80–90% of stars lie as dwarfs in a main sequence from upper left to lower right
  * Width of main sequence due to varying ages and compositions
* Initial theory was stars evolved from upper left to lower right;
  terminology of “earlier” (warmer) and “later” (cooler) stars remain
* Simple luminosity–temperature relation reveals fundamental dependence on mass
* Iso-radius lines run diagonally roughly parallel to main sequence
  * Warmer, more massive stars have a lower average density
* Supergiants such as Betelgeuse occupy extreme upper right

### Morgan−Keenan luminosity classes

* Maury noted subtle line width variations amongst stars with similar effective
  temperatures and different luminosities; found by Hertzsprung to differentiate
  main-sequence stars and giants
* Morgan and Keenan published atlas appending Roman numeral luminosity classes
  to Harvard spectral types
  * Ia/Ib for supergiants
  * V for main requence
  * VI for metal-deficient subdwarfs
  * Excludes white dwarfs, class D
* Luminosity classes roughly correlates with absolute magnitudes:
  enables placement of star on H−R diagram entirely from its spectrum
* **Spectroscopic parallax**: calculating distance modulus from the
  spectrally determined absolute magnitude
