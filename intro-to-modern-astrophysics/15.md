## 15. The Fate of Massive Stars

### Post-main-sequence evolution

| $M\;(M_\odot)$ | path to supernova            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| $\gtrsim85$    | O →  Of → LBV → WN → WC → SN |
| $40\sim85$     | O →  Of →  WN → WC → SN      |
| $25\sim40$     | O → RSG →  WN → WC → SN      |
| $20\sim25$     | o → RSG →  WN → SN           |
| $10\sim20$     | O → RSG → BSG → SN           |

* **Luminous blue variables** (LBVs; prototype: S Doradus):
  massive stars whose brightness suddenly erupt from time to time
  * Effective temperatures between $15\,000\sim30\,000$ K, masses $\gtrsim 85 M_\odot$,
    and luminosities $\gtrsim10^6 L_\odot$ approaching the Eddington limit
  * Possible mechanisms behind behavior include
    envelope mass loss from temporarily exceeding Eddington limit,
    atmospheric pulsation instabilities, and binary companions
* **Wolf–Rayet stars** (WR):
  very hot, rapidly rotating stars with unusually strong broad emission lines and high mass loss
  * Effective temperatures between $25\,000\sim100\,000$ K, masses $\gtrsim 20 M_\odot$,
    mass loss rates $\gtrsim 10^{-5} M_\odot/\text{year}$, and equatorial rotation speed ~300 km/s
  * Atypical spectral composition due to mass loss progressive stripping away outermost layers:
    WNs emission lines dominate in He and N; WCs in He and C; WOs in O
* Blue supergiants (BSG)
* Red supergiants (RSG)
  * Humphreys–Davidson luminosity limit: the most massive stars never evolve to RSG portion
    due to max luminosity cutoff
* Of stars: O supergiants with pronounced emission lines

### Supernova observation and classification

* Recorded Milky Way supernovae:
  SN 1006, SN 1054 with Crab supernova remnant,
  Tycho’s supernova SN 1572, and Kepler’s supernova SN 1604
* SN 1987A in Large Magellanic Clouds (50 kpc from Earth) first nearby supernova in age of modern astronomy
* Classified by spectra at maximum light and light curve shape:
  * **Type I supernova**: no H lines
    * H envelope already stripped before SN
    * Dimming $\sim 0.065$/day at 20 days, slowing to a constant rate after $\sim50$ days
    * Type Ia: Si II lines
      * Found in all galaxy types, including low-star-forming ellpticals
      * $M_B \approx -18.4$
      * Dimming $\sim0.015$/day after $\sim50$ days
    * Type Ib/Ic: no Si II lines
      * Only found in star-forming H II regions of spirals
      * $M_B \approx -16$
      * Dimming $\sim0.010$/day after $\sim50$ days
      * Type Ib: He lines
      * Type Ic: no He lines
  * **Type II supernova**: H lines; 
    * Type II-P: plateau
      * Temporary plateau in light curve between $30\sim80$ days
      * Occurs $\sim10\times$ as often as Type II-L
    * Type II-L: linear

### Core-collapse supernovae

* Type Ib, Ic, and II involve collapse of massive, evolved stellar core
* He burning eventually adds enough mass and density to CO core to start burning C, creating O–Ne core
* O–Ne then starts burning O, creating $^{28}_{14}$Si-dominated core 
* Si burning at $\sim3\times10^9$ K creates iron core with host of heavy nuclei centered near $^{56}_{26}$Fe
* Onion-like interior: Fe core ) Si-burning ) Si-rich ) O-burning ) O-rich ) C-burning ) C-rich ) He-burning ) He-rich ) H-burning ) H–He envelope
* Less energy released per mass, thus shorter timescale, with each successive fuel

| core-burning fuel | duration for $20 M_\odot$ star |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| H                 | $\sim10^7$ years               |
| He                | $\sim10^6$ years               |
| C                 | $\sim300$ years                |
| O                 | $\sim200$ days                 |
| Si                | $\sim2$ days                   |

* Extreme core temperature ($T_c\approx8\times10^9$ K) leads to **photodisintegration**: high-energy photons destroy heavy nuclei
  * $^{56}_{26}\text{Fe}+\gamma\to13{\;}^4_2\text{He}+4\text{n}$, $^4_2\text{He}+\gamma\to2\text{p}^++2\text{n}$
  * Highly endothermic, removing thermal pressure
* Extreme core temperature and density ($\rho_c\approx10^{13}$ kg/m$^{3}$) leads to heavy nuclei and photodisintegrated protons capturing free electrons, removing electron degeneracy pressure as well
* Loss of hydrostatic pressure causes core to collapse rapidly
* Inner core collapses homologously, decoupling from outer core where velocity becomes locally supersonic
* Collapse continues until density exceeds $8\times10^{17}$ kg/m$^{3}$ and strong force suddenly becomes repulsive due to neutron degeneracy pressure, sending shock waves to infalling outer core
* Supersonic outer core collapses in near free-fall $\sim70\,000$ km/s until heating and photodisintegrating upon encountering shock front
* Shock loses energy and stalls, becoming accretionary
* Extreme density traps neutrinos below in **neutrinosphere**
  * If neutrino energy reheats base of shock sufficiently quickly, shock resumes traveling outward 
  * Otherwise, material in shock falls back onto core and no explosion occurs
* Shock propels nuclear products and envelope material to kinetic energies $\sim10^{44}$ J
* Material becomes optically thin at $\sim10^3$ m $\approx100$ AU, releasing $\sim10^{42}$ J $\approx 10^9 L_\odot \approx L_\text{galaxy}$ of light
* $\sim3\times10^{46}$ J of neutrinos released as well
  * SN 1987A’s neutrinos traveled relativistically and arrived 3 hours before its photons, placing rest mass limit $m_{\nu_e} \leq 16$ eV
* **Neutron star** forms if remnant of inner core is small enough (neglecting rotation, $m\lesssim2.2M_\odot$ from $M_\text{ZAMS} \lesssim 25M_\odot$) to stablize from neutron degeneracy pressure; collapses into singularity and produces **black hole** otherwise
* Nebulae emit highly polarized synchotron radiation, with electrons supplied by center pulsar
* Spectral differencies of types II, Ib, and Ic due to composition and mass of envelope prior to, and radioactive material synthesized during core collapse
  * Type II usually from RSGs in H–R’s extreme upper left
    * SN 1987A was **subluminous** by $\sim3.5$ magnitudes relative to typical Type II supernovae due to being a denser BSG in the blue loop
  * Type Ib and Ic likely from WN and WC Wolf–Rayets, respectively
* Light curve plateau of Type II-P largely caused by prolonged recombination of H-rich envelope after shock ionization; further supported by radioactive decay of $^{56}_{28}$Ni in shock front
  * Light curve slope may be matched to decay of specific radioisotopes

### Supernova nucleosynthesis

* **Solar lithium problem**: solar convection zone predicted by stellar models too shallow to adequately burn Li, yet meteorites show primordial Li was $100\times$ the current solar Li abundance
* Synthesis of heavy-nuclei by charged particles extremely difficult due to Coulomb barrier, but neutron capture can occur at relatively low temperatures
  * Insignificant in energy production, but accounts for abundance ratios of nuclei $A>60$
  * Slow **s-process** yielding stable nuclei if $t_{\beta\text{-decay}} \ll t_\text{n-capture}$; tends to occur in normal phases of stellar evolution
  * Rapid **r-process** yielding neutron-rich nuclei if $t_{\beta\text{-decay}} \gg t_\text{n-capture}$; tends to occur in supernovae

### Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)

* Brief shower of gamma-ray photons between $1\sim10^6$ keV
* Rise time of $\sim10^{-4}$ s followed by exponential decay totaling $10^{-2}\sim10^3$ s
* Characteristic length $l = c\cdot t_\text{rise}$ roughly size of neutron star
* Emission between $350\sim500$ keV likely gravitationally redshifted pairs of 511-keV photons produced by e$^-$–e$^{+}$ annihilation on neutron star surface
* Emission between $20\sim60$ keV likely cyclotron lines from pulsar magnetic field $\sim10^8$ T
* Burst distribution isotropic throughout sky, but has radial edge corresponding to extragalactic distances
* Total energy released comparable to that of core-collapse supernovae
  * **Fluence** $S$: total energy released per detector surface area
* **Short–hard GRBs**: $\lesssim2$ s, associated with neutron star–neutron star or neutron star–black hole mergers
* **Long–soft GRBs**: $\gtrsim2$ s, associated with supernovae

### Long–soft GRBs

* Traced to the same locations as some supernovae
* **Relativistic jets**: beams of highly relativistic matter (Lorentz factor $\gamma$ possibly $\gtrsim100$)
  * For $\gamma\gg1$, beam cone has half-width angle $\theta\propto1/\gamma$
  * Doppler/**relativistic beaming**: if observer within beam, observed energy and collimation will be greater than what is actually emitted
  * Models must avoid slow-down from relativistic speeds after encountering too much (cumulative rest mass $m_0\gtrsim\gamma m_\text{jet}c^2$) baryon-rich material from envelope
* Hypernova/**collapsar model**: black hole formed directly from supernova
  * Debris disk and associated magnetic fields collimate relativistic jets emanating from center of supernova
  * Gamma rays emitted as jets encounter infalling stellar envelope
* **Supranova model**: rotating neutron star with $M \gtrsim2.2M_\odot$ spins down over weeks to months and collapses into black hole
  * Stellar envelope has already been cleared away by supernova
  * Debris disk and associated magnetic fields produce both relativistic jets and a GRB

### Cosmic rays

* Penetrating radiation of charged particles comprising wide range of classes (), masses, and energies ($10^7\sim10^{20}$ eV)
* Subatomic particles including e$^\pm$, p$^+$, $\mu^\pm$, and atomic nuclei including C, Ne, Mg, Si, Fe, Ni
* **Solar cosmic rays** relatively low energy, with $\sim750$ km/s protons in fast solar wind having $E\approx 3$ keV, and $\sim0.1c$ protons from CMEs having $E\approx10$ MeV
* Supernova-origin cosmic rays travel relativistically $\sim c$ with $E\lesssim10^{16}$ eV
* Charged particles orbit magnetic fields at **Larmor radius** / gyroradius $r = {\gamma m v\over q B}$
  * While trapped in field, particle is accelerated to relativistic speeds by successive collisions with advancing shock wave
  * With sufficient energy $\sim10^{15}$ eV, $r$ exceeds size scale of supernova remnant $\sim1$ pc and particle is likely ejected
* Possible origins for highest-energy cosmic rays;
  * Acceleration near neutron stars or black holes
  * Collisions involving intergalactic shocks
  * Emission from active galactic nuclei around supermassive black hole
