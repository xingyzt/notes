## 16. The Degenerate Remnants of Stars

### White dwarfs (WDs)

* Manufactured in cores of low- and intermediate-mass stars ($M_\text{ZAMS}\lesssim8M_\odot$)
* Low luminosity despite high central temperature indicate lack of fuel for thermonuclear reaction
* Primarily comprises completedly ionized C and O nuclei, but extreme gravity stratifies interior into CO core ) He layer ) H layer over $\sim100$ years
* $0.4\sim0.7M_\odot$, $\sim R_\oplus$, $\rho\approx10^9$ kg/m$^3$, $g\approx 10^6$ m/s$^2$, $T\approx5000\sim80\,000$ K
* Interior nearly isothermal due to energy transfer via highly efficient, degenerate **electron conduction**; steep temperature drop in nondegenerate envelope drive convection mixing in surface layers 
* Thermal energy primarily resides in kinetic energy of nuclei, as nearly all electrons are in degenerate energy levels
* Core cools at $T_\text{core}(t) = T_0\left(1+{5\over2}{t\over\tau_0}\right)^{-2/5}$
  * Luminosity $L\propto T_\text{core}^{7/2} \propto T_\text{eff}^4$: interior cools faster than surface
  * At $\sim10^{-4}L_\odot$, nuclei begin crystallizing, slowing cooling
* Spectral lines significantly broadened due extreme pressure near surface
* Spectral type D (dwarf)
  * **DA**: only H absorption lines; $\sim70\%$ of population
  * **DB**: only He absorption lines; $\sim8\%$ of population
  * **DC**: featureless continuum; $\sim14\%$ of population
  * **DQ**: additional C lines
  * **DZ**: additional metal lines
  * **DO**: in between O type and WD
  * **PNN**: planetary nebula nuclei; WD formation phase
  * Convective mixing may transform WD between spectral subtypes
* **Pulsating white dwarfs**: on instability strip with periods of $100\sim1000$ s  
  * Multiple periods with $3\sim125$ different simultaneous frequencies
  * Nonradial g-modes resonating in H and He layers cause surface temperature variations without much effect on radius
  * **DAV stars** (prototype: ZZ Ceti): $T_\text{eff}\approx12\;000$ K; resonance driven by H partial ionization zone
  * **DBV stars**: $T_\text{eff}\approx27\;000$ K; resonance driven by He partial ionization zone
  * **DOV** and **PNNV** stars: $T_\text{eff}\approx10^5$ K

### Degenerate matter

* Degeneracy of electron fermion gas responsible for maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium in white dwarfs
* **Fermion gas**: obeying the Pauli exclusion principle, only one particle is allowed per state
  * At $T = 0$ K, all energy states below the **Fermi energy** $\varepsilon_F = {\hbar^2\over2m} (3\pi^2n)^{2/3}$ are occupied and the fermion gas is fully degenerate
  * For $T > 0$ K, fermion gases are still approximately degenerate if average thermal energy ${3\over2}kT < \varepsilon_F$; for an electron gas, ${T\over\rho^{2/3}}<1261$ K m$^2$ kg$^{-2/3}$
* Nonrelativistic **degeneracy pressure** $P = {(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\over5} {\hbar^2\over m} n^{5/3}$
  * Dynamically stable: $P\propto \rho^\gamma$ where adiabatic index $\gamma={5\over3}$
  * Yields nonrelativistic **mass–volume relation**: $V\propto {1\over M}$ and $\rho\propto M^2$
  * Largely temperature independent, leading to He flash in degenerate cores
* Electrons become relativistic at $\rho\approx10^9$ kg/m$^3$
* As $v_e\to c$ at high $M$, adiabatic index $\gamma\to{4\over3}$ and WD becomes dynamically unstable
* **Chandrasekhar limit**: maximum mass supported by electron degeneracy, $M_\text{Ch}\approx0.44M_\odot$

### Neutron stars (NSs)

* $\sim10^{57}$ extremely densely packed neutrons with $\sim M_\text{Ch}$ , $R\approx10\sim15$ km , $\rho\approx10^{17}$ kg/m$^3$, $g\approx10^{12}$ m/s$^2$
* Rapid rotation on order of milliseconds to seconds guaranteed due to role in countering collapse
* Extremely hot formation temperatures $\sim10^{11}$ K cooled in days to $T_\text{core}\approx 10^9$ K by internal neutron–antineutrino radiation via **URCA process**: $\text{n}\to\text{p}^++\text{e}^-+\overline{\nu}_\text{e}$, $\text{p}^++\text{e}^-\to\text{n}+\overline{\nu}_\text{e}$
* Other neutrino emission processes cool $T_\text{core}$ to $\sim10^9$ K over $\sim10^3$ years, then surface photon radiation (primarily in X-ray) cools $T_\text{core}$ to $\sim10^8$ K and $T_\text{eff}$ to $\sim10^6$ K over $\sim10^4$ years
* Outer crust: for low $\rho$ near surface, iron nuclei minimize nucleon energy and electron degeneracy pressure dominates
* **Neutronization**: above $\rho\gtrsim10^{12}$ kg/m$^3$, capture of relativistic electrons $\text{p}^++\text{e}^-\to\text{n}+\nu_\text{e}$ minimizes nucleon energy and produces increasingly neutron-rich nuclei
  * Additional neutrons reduce electric repulsion between protons
* Inner crust: above $\rho\gtrsim4\times10^{14}$ kg/m$^3$, **neutron drip** minimizes nucleon energy, creating superfluid of free neutrons outside of the nuclei lattice
  * **Superfluid**: free, degenerate fermions pair up into bosons, which flow without viscosity
* Above $\rho\gtrsim4\times10^{15}$ kg/m$^3$, neutron degeneracy pressure dominates
* Core: as  $\rho\to\rho_\text{nucleus}\approx2\times10^{17}$ kg/m$^3$, nuclei effectively dissolve into superfluid of free neutrons, protons, and electrons; as $\rho$ increases further, $\text{n}:\text{p}^+:\text{e}^-\to8:1:1$
  * Superfluid of charged particles are **superconducting**, flowing without electrical resistance
  * Conducting fluids “freeze-in” magnetic field lines, creating magnetic fields $B\approx10^8\sim10^{10}$ T
* Physics poorly understood above $\rho>\rho_\text{nucleus}$ at the deep interior
* Above $\rho>2\rho_\text{nucleus}$, neutrons spontaneously decay $\text{n}\to\text{p}^++\pi^-$, producing other elementary particles

### Pulsars

* First discovered by Bell in 1967: two independent interstellar sources of regularly spaced radio pulses
* Designated PSR (pulsating source of radio) *right ascention* + *declination*
* Most periods range $0.25\sim2$ s, spinning down very gradually with ${\dot P}\approx10^{-15}$ 
  * X-ray pulsars have the longest periods and fastest spindown
  * High-energy pulsars emitting radio to IR or higher frequencies have typical periods but faster-than-average spindown
  * Young **millisecond pulsars** ($P\lesssim10$ ms) emit radio to gamma rays and display **glitches**: periods abruptly spinup every several years, possibly from crust shrinking, or separation of core from crust
  * Some pulsars, primarily those in binary systems, are speedin up ($\dot P<0$)
* Only explainable by rapidly rotating neutron stars
  * Oscillation modes of white dwarfs are too long and oscillation modes of neutron stars are too short
  * Rapid period rules out all binary systems larger than neutron stars; increasing period rules out inspiraling radiation of NS binaries
* Much faster movements through space than normal stars, and rarity of pulsar binary systems, indicate ejection from asymetric core-collapse supernovae
* Rotational kinetic energy transformed into accelerating expansion of surrounding nebulae, maintaining strength of magnetic field, and injecting relativistic electrons into the field
* Acceleration of relativistic electrons along magnetic field lines (**curvature radiation**) or circling around them (**synchotron radiation**) produce light strongly linearly polarized in the plane of acceleration
* Individual pulses of a pulsar vary substantially, but integrated pulse profile averaged across 100s of pulses is very stable
  * Each pulse comprises several brief subpulses, either distributed randomly in the main pulse window or drifting across the profile
  * Sharpness disperses with distance in the interstellar medium, as longer wavelengths slow more below $c_\text{vacuum}$
  * Some pulsars abruptly switch between multiple integrated pulse profiles; some pulsars temporarily cease emitting pulses for some periods
* Magnetic poles are off-axis and have field strength $B={1\over2\pi R^3\sin\theta}\sqrt{3\mu_0 c^3 I P \dot P\over 2\pi}$
  * Where $\theta$ is pole inclination relative to axis of rotation and $I$ is moment of inertia
* Rotation rapidly changes B field, inducing changes in E field and generating EM waves radiating away from star as **magnetic dipole radiation** $\dot E=-{32\pi^5B^2R^6\sin^2\theta\over3\mu_0c^3P^4}$
  * Fast-spinning neutron stars lose energy much more quickly
* Powerful induced surface E field $\sim6.3\times10^{10}$ V/m rips charged particles from polar regions
  * Emit energetic curvature radiation, some of which undergo pair production $\gamma\to\text{e}^-+\text{e}^+$ and generate more charged particles, creating a cascade of subpulses beamed in narrow cone around pole
  * Capture by magnetic fields form co-rotating magnetosphere which detaches at **light cylinder** $R_c=c/\omega$ as a pulsar wind, replenishing charged particles and magnetic field in surrounding nebula
* Pulse mechanism may turn off when rotation slows down too much to sustain strong magnetic field, or pulses may simply become too faint

### Magnetars

* Extremely magnetic neutron stars with $B\approx10^{11}$ T
* Stresses in magnetic field cause surface to crack, producing super-Eddington ($10^3\sim10^4L_\text{Eddington}$) releases of energy
* Explains **soft gamma repeaters** (SGRs): objects associated with fairly young ($\sim10^4$ years-old) supernovae emitting bursts of hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray
* Relatively slow rotation periods ranging $5\sim8$ s: magnetic field primarily governs behavior rather than rotation
