## 11. The Sun

* Loosely treated as two parts:
  an optically thin atmosphere and an optically thick core
* Transition is $\sim600$ km thick

### Solar interior

* Hydrogen burning below $R \lesssim 0.3 R_\odot$; convection above $R \gtrsim 0.7 R_\odot$
* Heterogeneous composition due to nucleosynthesis, convection, and elmental diffusion
* $^4_2$He is more abundant than $^1_1$H below $R \lesssim 0.1 R_\odot$
* $^3_2$He abundance peaks at the top of the hydrogen-burning region,
  where cooler temperatures slow the $^3_2$He–$^3_2$He reaction
* Convection zone turbulence creates homogeneous composition
* Peak energy generation region is shell around $r \approx 0.1 R_\odot$
  * ${dL\over dr}$ affected by shell volume and fuel availability,
    both smaller at the very center, as well as temperature and pressure
* Surface Li abundance somewhat less than expected for the current solar model
* **Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein effect**: neutrino oscillation between the
  $\text{e}^-$, $\mu^-$, and $\tau^-$ flavors explains the solar neutrino problem of only ⅓ as many
  $\text{e}^-$ neutrinos as expected being detected from the solar core

### Photosphere

* Where optical photons originate
* Starts 100 km below where $\tau_\text{500 nm} = 1$, extending $\sim600$ km
* Temperature drops from $\sim9400$ K at base to $\gtrsim4400$ K at top
* Continuum opacity partly due to H$^-$ near base of photosphere,
  as the far more abundant neutral H I cannot contribute much to the continuum
* Absorption lines produced in higher, cooler, more opaque regions of the photosphere
* **Granulation**: patches of bright and dark regions ($\sim700$ km) at base of photosphere due to
  underlying convection zone; Doppler shifts ($\sim0.4$ km/s) cause wiggles in absorption lines
  * Characteristic lifetime ($\sim10$ minutes) corresponds to the time a
    convection eddy takes to rise and fall 1 mixing length
* **Differential rotation**: Doppler shifts at solar limb and solar oscillations
  show the solar rotation varies by latitude and by radius
  * Period of 25 days at equator lengths to 36 days at poles
  * **Tachocline**: base of convection zone ($\sim 0.65 R_\odot$) where differing rotation rates converge,
    resulting in strong shear theorized to create plasma which
    generate the solar magnetic field

### Chromosphere

* Where temperature begins rising again, from 4400 to ~10,000 K
* Starts 525 km above where $\tau_\text{500 nm} = 1$, extending ~1600 km
* Density and intensity $\approx 10^{-4}$ of the photosphere
* Low density and high temperature produce certain absorption and emission lines,
* As the blackbody continuum emission peaks ~500 nm, visible-spectrum emission lines are
  only clearly seen in a flash spectrum of the limb near total eclipse
* Strength of $\text{H}\alpha$ emission line allows filters to selectively observe the chromosphere structure
* **Supergranulation**: patches of ~30,000 km wide from underlying convection
* **Spicules**: vertical gas filaments extending upwards for ~10,000 km,
  ejecting mass at ~15 km/s

### Transition region

* Starts $\sim2100$ km above $\tau_\text{500 nm} = 1$, extending to the corona
* Temperature rises rapidly to $\sim10^5$ K in 100 km, then slowly to $\gtrsim10^6$ K
* Selectively observed in various UV bands (e.g. Lyman $\alpha$ at $\sim20\,000$ K)

### Corona

* Faint region ($\lesssim 10^{15} \text{ particles/m}^3$) with vaguely defined outer boundary
* High-temperature, high-thermal-conductivity, approximately isothermal plasma
* Quiet corona near sunspot minimum (low solar activity)
  * More extended at equator than poles, consistent with nearly dipole magnetic field
* Active corona near sunspot maximum
  * More complex magnetic field shape and structure
* Essentially transparent to most EM radiation
* Not in local thermodynamic equilibrium thus no strictly definable temperature,
  but estimated to be $\gtrsim 2 \times 10^6 \text{ K}$
* **Parker wind model**: not in hydrostatic equilibrium as pressure does not vanish at infinity,
  implying solar wind
* Kontinuierlich/continuous **K corona**:
  * From free electron scattering of photospheric light primary between $1 \sim 2.3 R_\odot$
  * Spectral lines essentially blended into continuum from high-velocity Doppler broadening
* Fraunhofer **F corona**:
  * From  dust scattering of photospheric light beyond $2.3 R_\odot$
  * Slower dust grains have less Doppler broadening and leave detectable Fraunhofer lines
  * Merges with zodiacal light from interplanetary dust
* Emission **E corona**:
  * From highly ionized coronal atoms, very rich in emission lines in the X-ray spectrum
  * Low number density enable forbidden transitions between metastable energy levels,
    as well as low-energy free-free transitions that produce radio waves
  * Radio waves also produced by relativistic electrons’ synchrotron radiation

### Solar wind

* Stream of escaped ions and electrons
* Deflects comets’ ion tails differently than pure radiation pressure on their dust tails
* Trapped into Van Allen belts by planetary magnetospheres and
  create aurorae upon reaching atmosphere
* Fast solar wind: $\sim750$ km/s, produced from open magnetic fields
  * Associated with coronal holes — darker, cooler coronal regions
* Slow solar wind: $\sim300$ km/s, produced by coronal streamers around closed magnetic fields;
  * Associated with X-ray bright spots from trapped spiralling charges
* **Heliopause**: outer limit of the Sun’s EM influence;
  where solar wind meets the interstellar medium and produces a **termination shock**
* **Heliosheath**: beyond the termination shock,
  particles slow, magnetic field strengthens, and density increases

### Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)

* Longitudinal pressure waves propagate outward from top of convection zone
* Drastic drop in medium density turn waves supersonic, creating shock fronts
  that drastically heat up chromospheric gas as they dissipate
* Magnetic energy density and pressure $u = P = {B^2\over2\mu_0}$
* Transverse **Alfvén waves** propagate from oscillations in magnetic field lines
* Resistive Joule heating from electrical currents in Alfvén waves also
  contributes to temperature rise, in particular the steep gradient of the transition region
* Open magnetic field lines are dragged by stellar rotation across interplanetary space,
  slowing stars down significantly over their lifetimes

### Sunspots

* Zeeman splitting indicates strong magnetic fields,
  which inhibit convective motion below and create dark spots
* Umbra: darkest portion with vertical field lines; diameter $\lesssim 30\,000 $km
* Penumbra: border with filament-like structure with field lines becoming horizontal
* Generally located in groups,
  with one dominant sunspot leading several in the direction of rotation
  * Lead sunspots in the same hemisphere always have the same polarity
    during an 11-year cycle
  * Opposite polarity in the other hemisphere
* Frequency follows 11-year cycle, starting from sunspot minimum
* **Butterfly diagram**: average latitude starts near $\pm40^\circ$, migrating to the equator over cycle
* Solar polarity reverses during sunspot minimum, thus technically 22-year cycle
* Long-term variations include the Maunder minimum spanning 1645–1715

### Plages

* Chromospheric regions of higher density and bright H$\alpha$ emission
* Located near sunspots, forming before they appear and vanishing after they disappear
* Caused by magnetic fields

### Flares

* Eruptive events releasing $10^{17}\sim10^{25}$ J of energy over timespans from milliseconds to over an hour
* May reach 100,000 km in length
* Develop in sunspot groups with intense stored magnetic energy
* Reconnection of magnetic field lines creates a sheet of current in the plasma,
  Joule heating the gas up to $10^8$ K
* Charged particles are accelerated away from the reconnection point
  * $\text{H}\alpha$ line becomes locally in emission from ejected particles
    recombining by the base of the field lines
  * Solar cosmic rays from particles ejected towards outer space
* Nonthermal radio waves from synchrotron radiation around field lines
* Soft X-rays from high temperatures in loop below reconnection point
* Hard X- and gamma-rays from surface nuclear reactions,
  including **spallation** of heavy nuclei: $^1_1\text{H} + {\;}^{16}_8\text{O} \to {\;}^{12}_6\text{C}+ {\;}^4_2\text{He} + {\;}^1_1\text{H} + \gamma$

### Prominences

* **Quiescent prominence**:
  * Curtains of cooler ($\sim8000$ K) ionized gas collected along magnetic field lines
  * May be stable for weeks
  * Appear as dark filaments against the disk
* Eruptive/**active prominence**:
  * Suddenly destabilized magnetic field configuration
  * Energy converted into lifting prominence away from the Sun

### Coronal mass ejections (CMEs)

* Ejects $5 \times 10^{12} \sim 5 \times 10^{13} \text{ kg}$ of material at speeds of $400\sim1000$ km/s
* $\sim1$/day, more frequent near sunspot maximum
* 70% correlated with eruptive prominences; 40% correlated with flares

### Magnetic activity in other stars

* **Flare stars**: M-type main-sequence stars whose occasional rapid fluctuation in brightness
  may be due to large flares on their relatively dimr surface
* Starspots may be used to measure stellar rotation
* Magnetic field lines measured from Zeeman broadening correlate with luminosity variations
