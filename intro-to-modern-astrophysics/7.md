## 7. Binary Systems and Stellar Parameters

* In many cases, allows the calculation of stellar masses, highlighting a
  well-defined mass-luminosity relation for the large majority of stars

### Classifications

* **Optical double**: Fake binaries that just look close
* (The rest of the classes are not mutually exclusive)
* **Visual binary**: Both stars are resolved
* **Astrometric binary**: Visual oscillatory motion of one star implies companion
* **Eclipsing binary**: Periodic variation in light curves reveal two stars
* **Spectrum binary**: Different spectral classes / Doppler effect reveal superimposed spectra
* **Spectroscopic binary**: Doppler effect in spectra reveal oscillation of
  radial velocity curves

### Mass determination of visual binaries

* Mass ratio from ratio of subtended angles: ${m_1 \over m_2} = {r_2 \over r_1} = {\alpha_2 \over \alpha_1}$
* If distance to system and inclination are known, masses can be determined:
  $m_1 + m_2 = {4\pi^2 \over G} {d^3 \over \cos^3 i} {\alpha^3 \over P ^2}$
  * Where i is the angle of inclination between the orbit and the sky’s planes

### Mass determination of spectroscopic binarie

* Mainly detected from binaries with high inclinations
* “**Double-line**” if both spectra are visible; “**single-line**” otherwise
* Radial velocity curves cross at the radial velocity of the center of mass
* Radial velocity curve amplitudes scaled uniformly by $\sin i$
* Eccentricity skews the curves, but close binaries tend to quickly
  circularize from tidal forces
* Mass ratio: ${m_1 \over m_2} = {v_2 \over v_1}$
  * Where v are radial velocities
* If inclination is known, masses can be determined:
  $m_1 + m_2 = {P \over 2 \pi G} \left(v_1 + v_2 \over \sin i\right)^3$,
* If only one radial velocity is known (single-line binary),
  then mass ratio cannot be found,
  but the mass function still provides rough constraints:
  ${(m_2 \sin i)^3\over(m_1 + m_2)^2} = {P \over 2\pi G} v_1^3$

### Temperature ratio and radii determination of eclipsing binaries

* Two dips in the light curve:
  * Primary eclipse: hotter star passes behind cooler one
  * Secondary eclipse: cooler star passes behind warmer one
  * Size doesn’t matter
* If smaller star $T_1$ is hotter, temperature ratio from brightness is
  ${B_0 − B_1 \over B_0 − B_2} = \left( T_1 \over T_2 \right)^4$
* Unless extremely close binary, inclination $i \approx 90^\circ$,
  thus allowing accurate mass and velocity determination
* Radius of star $r = {v\Delta t\over2}$
  * Where $v$ is relative velocity,
    and $\Delta t$ is transit time for the smaller star, or eclipse time for the larger

### Computer modeling

* May incorporate tidal deformations, surface tempreature variations,
  flux distributions, etc
* Generates synthetic light curves to compare against observational data

### Extrasolar planets (exoplanets)

* Direct observation very difficult due to vast luminosity differences
* Indirect methods: spectral radial velocities, astrometric wobbles, and eclipses
* First exoplanet around a Sun-like star discovered in 1995
* Many rapidly followed due to dramatic advances in detector technology,
  large-aperture telescopes, and long-term observing campaigns
